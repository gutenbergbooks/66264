<p>An air of apprehension pervaded the throne room.</p>

<p>The most imperfect day known for ages in the Court of
Gehenna was drawing to a close. The seven Tartarean
courtiers had effaced themselves as far back in the auditorium
as the folds of its black and red electric hangings
would permit. Each held eyes and ears intent, realizing far
too well that his particular tenure of preferment hung upon
the mood of the moment. Even the prime minister, Old
Original Sin, who had weathered so many Apollyon storms
that he well might have considered himself immune, sat ill
at ease in his chair of honor upon the dais.</p>

<p>His Satanic Majesty leaned forward from the throne
chair, imposing in its effect of onyx and gold. His head
drooped as though from weight other than the voltage of
his crown. His elbows pressed upon the chair-arms, that
both his strong, long hands might stroke in turn his pointed,
copper-colored beard. About the room, as lightning plays
in advance of thunder, flashed his gray-eyed glances. When
he spoke, although in a mild voice, each auditor quivered
through taut nerves.</p>

<p>“Draw the night curtains. Throw on every switch. I
dislike this pale, abiding light.”</p>

<p>Without awaiting the attendants, the courtiers sprang to
do the royal will. Sin himself operated the electric switch-board.
At his touch, a design in heraldry blazed from the
wall behind the dais. In pseudo-seeming, bands of ebony
and of beryl formed the setting for a golden crown in bas
relief, its points pricked out with emeralds. Projecting from
its headband, three horns of power suspended from their
tips the ruby-writ words “Japheth,” “Shem” and “Ham.”
The crown itself looked to rest upon a sword that dripped
all jewels known, like tears of every agony, from those of
water to those of blood. Beneath, through letters transparent
as thin sardonyx, flamed this caption:</p>

<p class="text-in-box">
SATAN the FIRST and LAST.<br />
Outcast of Paradise<br />
Heir-apparent to Earth<br />
Monarch of Greater Gehenna
</p>

<p>His Highness glanced back at this elaborate conceit and
a gratified expression crossed his face. He signed a page
to spread out his crackling mantle of gold-bordered black;
slanted a self-respecting look at the splendid proportions
revealed through his easy-fitting body garment of opaque
red light; matched his long-nailed finger-tips in pairs.</p>

<p>The seven waited with increased perturbation. They knew
that calm, considering look to presage some diabolical idea;
realized that no flattery might blind that super-keen sight;
appreciated that the day had run too unevenly for hope
of a restful end.</p>

<p>From the moment of the royal rising that early morn, the
King had seemed of malevolent mind. The attendants in
his private suite insisted that he had quit the royal bed from
the right side. Yet he had seemed to assimilate perversity
from his static shower, declaring the current hot when, in
fact, it was cold as refrigeration could make it. In a passion
he had unwound the small dynamo of a new costume considered
by his chief tailor a creation; later had hurled his
breakfast filectric-mignon at the first chef, asserting that
it bore no resemblance, either in appearance or gastronomic
satisfaction, to the beefsteaks of men.</p>

<p>The inadequate light cast by his pet device, an imitation
of Sol, had provoked a personally conducted investigation
of the mammoth power plant in the lower badlands. Disregarding
the affairs which awaited his personal direction, he
had spent the noon hour tinkering at the mechanism of his
sun, moon and flock of stars.</p>

<p>At the General Assembly of Demons his ill-temper had
gained momentum. After listening for a time in sneering
impatience to suggestions offered as amendments to the
general proposition of standardizing crime, he had hurled
upon that august body a very cataclysm of political overthrow.
One by one he had assailed the ministry, down to
the most faded of those angel plotters cast out with him at
The Fall. Announcing that he would run the nether world
alone and unaided, he had dissolved the cabinet, assigning
its members to labors futile as their protests.</p>

<p>In view of his treatment of those who had served him
so long and so infernally, what was in store for mere
courtiers, sycophants of a few recent centuries?</p>

<p>When he straightened in the throne-chair, each of the
seven straightened with him. When, tilting his crown at an
easier slant, he glanced speculatively about, all crowded back
against the highly charged curtains and tried to look indifferent
at the shock.</p>

<p>His gaze settled upon the prime minister.</p>

<p>“Sin, you aborigine, a word!”</p>

<p>Old Original&mdash;so called because his visability, like the
King’s own, never had dimmed&mdash;made obvious effort to
assume the sang-froid of one who knows himself to be
indispensable; sauntered to the steps; bent in an obeisance
of elaborate mockery.</p>

<p>“Future of the Universe, I await your will,” he remarked
with nasal twang.</p>

<p>Satan looked contemptuous of his handyman’s forced
effrontery.</p>

<p>“I know you do. You’ve taken to awaiting my will entirely
too much for your own good. There was a time when you
were full of vile ideas. But you’ve lost your ingenuity of
late. Since when have you designed a sin-mask that would
deceive the least suspicious of earthlings or invented a new
form of torture with which to demonstrate our canons of
damnation?”</p>

<p>The aged demon, forced on the defensive, eyed the Master
with reproach.</p>

<p>“Æons agone there ceased to be anything new beneath
the sun and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you,” His Highness interrupted, “may be dispensed
with if that is true. I am proficient in all the old tricks
myself. However, I am disposed to give you a chance to
disprove it, being ever kind and just. Is that not true?”
The lightning of his look threatened the seven sycophants.
“Am I not ever kind and just?”</p>

<p>“As the hope of Hell!”</p>

<p>“Oftener than ever!”</p>

<p>“In our best-worst interests, Sire!”</p>

<p>The medley whined from the shimmering shadows.</p>

<p>Sin’s voice gained in assurance, even as his mind lost at
the trend of Satanic argument.</p>

<p>“But, my King, haven’t I had the whole mortal world at
war? Didn’t I trick all peoples into slaughter of each other
as you planned?”</p>

<p>“I notice you use the past-perfect tense in speaking of that
late little unpleasantness. As a matter of fact we lost out
on it&mdash;lost our one best bet since Noah and the Flood. How
did you make the mistake of assuming that any scrapper
who falls fighting for his country could be condemned by his
fellow men? The worst of them is guaranteed a passport
to Abraham’s bosom. As for the leaders&mdash;the brains of
the drive&mdash;most of them were lost to us through that meanest
of mortal weaknesses, fear for the integrity of their own
hides. They all want to live. That is what’s wrong with
conquerors. When earth-wars are such good training
for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His Highness’ teeth bit the sentence in two. His saber-like
gaze slashed suspiciously from face to face.</p>

<p>“You do your own army an injustice to compare its
morals with that of any on earth,” soothed the old toady.
“I’ll acknowledge that I am somewhat used up. Even Sin
might get brain-fag, you know.”</p>

<p>“That excuse is antedated. You have had ample time to
recuperate.” The royal digits made a crackling sound as
they touched. “You failed egregiously on every important
specification of the big fight. Did you keep them at it until
the world was engulfed in one red sea of gore? Did you
inoculate hate until it over-ruled every gentler human impulse?
Did you overcome the too-young at home and the
too-old who were to instruct them and the women who were
to bear the spawn to continue the slaughter? With all the
possibilities of modern wholesaleness, that war was not
half what it should have been.”</p>

<p>“Admitting all you say,” the prime minister defended, “I
don’t see cause for your august dissatisfaction over our
progress with the mortal world.”</p>

<p>“You don’t? What you need is an oculist.”</p>

<p>His Majesty descended the steps and began to pace the
great room.</p>

<p>“I have had a day of realization,” he continued in lifted
voice. “Something must be done. Things are too slow to
suit my purposes. We are not getting our share of those
who enter Shadow Land. Entirely too many are ticketed
through to the Fields by Mors.”</p>

<p>“You know, Sire, something of my efforts to buy that
stubborn old keeper of the outer gate,” interpolated Sin.
“Nothing I offer seems to have any value to him. He is
polite enough, but drones always the same reminder that for
the present he must abide by the records of Earth.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is not with Mors, fool fiend,” Satan snapped.
“It is with that book of his&mdash;with the ‘Judgments of Men.’
The feelings of mortals do soften sickeningly toward their
dead. They say the good die young. Certainly we try to
see to it that the bad die old. That’s why everything has
seemed to depend upon our new searchlight summoning
towers. Mors is able, with only two such towers ranged
on either side the Mystery Gate, to make his lists, set his
automatic finders and turn on his power. What results?
Every evening and all night long they come at his call.
There’s certainly nothing attractive about the patriarch. He
is grim as the first law of mortality and looks it. Yet every
witness he subpœnas <i>comes</i>. Nothing stops them, the long,
drear journey, the fear of the unknown, the hissing belly-crawlers
along the way. What happens when <i>I</i> build a
dozen searchlight towers to his two? I make my selected
list of earthlings for whom no modern Ananias could pass
a good word. I set my alleged finders and turn on all the
power we can generate. With what result?”</p>

<p>Glaringly though he challenged reply, none who knew his
latest scheme to add to the population of his kingdom dared
remind him of its failure. Of necessity he answered himself.</p>

<p>“For a week now our tower tops have been shafting calls
to Earth. Has one of the nominated accepted? I am forced
to admit that there is something more to this death business
than searchlighting. I’ve never been so disappointed since
Pontius Pilate double-crossed me.”</p>

<p>“Wait until Mors summons the choice crowd of leaders
you mention who started the world war,” Sin suggested.</p>

<p>“Wait? That seems to be your persistent idea. I tell you
we can’t afford to wait.”</p>

<p>Halting before the lesser fiend, Satan seared him with a
look.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect you even to suggest where the Associated
Electricians of Gehenna have failed. And in other respects
your title and office are jeopardized. I offer you a last
chance to save them. If overnight you invent some new
feasible scheme for conscripting earthlings into our standing
army, your job is saved. If not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The feasible idea already is invented and its workings
under way, O King. Compared with it, all our past schemes
are limited and crude. Camouflaged under propaganda of
universal appeal, it cannot fail to start a whirlpool which will,
in time, suck every man, woman and child into moral death.”</p>

<p>“You refer to Bolshevism, I suppose? Not a good idea&mdash;not
good at all. The germ of it has lain in my mind for
centuries. I’d suggest that you saunter to the outer gates
and quiz the evening’s grist. You might happen upon a Red
recruit with cheering news.”</p>

<p>“The very thing I was about to propose,” Old Original
made reply on his way to the door.</p>

<p>The ruler frankly sneered. “Great minds, eh? Are you
trying to flatter yourself or me? While you are going, take
the wall decorations with you.” He included the courtiers
in his gesture. “How many centuries do you obsoletes need
to rise to the worst that’s in you? Do you suppose for one
split-second&mdash;mortal time&mdash;that I’d work with evil natures
as I have done since that fracas up in Paradise just for the
company of the evilest of them through eternity? By
to-morrow I shall have decided what to do with such choice
parasites. Out with you, or I’ll fit my skeleton key to the
trap-door of the bottomless pit and throw you in before
your time.”</p>

<p>With alacrity which showed their relief at this temporary
escape, the seven followed the prime minister through the
separating rays of the rear curtain.</p>

<p>Satan looked to share their relief that they were gone.
For a space silence reigned with him in the throne room
except for the snap of his heels upon the floor and the
swish of the royal robe. His reflection in one of the mercurized
panels of the side walls caused him to halt. For
long he studied his face, then, straightening, appreciated his
magnificent outlines. A look of satisfaction cleared the
frown of evil affairs from his brow. Lifting his crown,
he bowed into the mirror.</p>

<p>A voice from behind the curtain also saluted him:</p>

<p>“‘<i>No wonder that thy heart was lifted up, that thy wisdom
was corrupted by reason of thy brightness.</i>’”</p>

<p>“Step out, caitiff. Be as apparent as your flattery. Why
do you linger to spy upon me when I order the court
cleared?”</p>

<p>A Balial glare fixed upon the returned minister’s ingratiating
grin.</p>

<p>“Not to spy upon you, Sire. Rather, to admire you. You
certainly are the Boss of Below for looks.”</p>

<p>His Highness, never having outlived his first fault of
vanity, gave benefit of doubt to the compliment, as also to
the glass-like tumbler bewhiskered with crisp-crackling green
held toward him.</p>

<p>“I thought Your Majesty’s harassed spirit might feel in
need of refreshment, so made bold to have this quaff mixed.
It is as near as may be like those they have voted too strong
for the United States of America, suh. Here you are&mdash;a
frappé low-bolt!”</p>

<p>Sin proffered both explanation and cup with that irrepressibility
which so far had made, but at any moment might
break him. With sympathy sips, he watched the sampling
of the liquidized current concocted by the first royal bartender,
a past-master indeed of the art before it was amended
off Forty-second Street and Broadway, New York.</p>

<p>“Get the kick?” he asked, fearing as much as hoping that
the julep would fail of its effect.</p>

<p>Satan threw the goblet on the floor, where it snapped and
flashed, but did not break.</p>

<p>“If I didn’t, you would.”</p>

<p>Sin believed him. From experience he had learned the
difficulty of gauging the moods of m’lord after a few such
applications had filed or smoothed the edges of his tooth-sharp
temper. For safety’s sake he gave a side glance into
the sensitized panel.</p>

<p>“Notice the size of you as compared with me&mdash;and I am
supposed to be well-developed from my criminal calisthenics.”</p>

<p>His Highness frowned. He also “noticed.”</p>

<p>“Where is the value in good looks,” he conceded, “if
there’s none around whom you admire to admire you?”</p>

<p>Old Original was quick to follow the advantage. “A word
on that very subject is what I returned to say, a word of
condolence and advice.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> offer condolence and advice to <i>me</i>?” The King of
Evil glared at the most malapert fiend of his kingdom.</p>

<p>“Condolence, Sire, over your state of solitariness. Advice
as to how to ease it. From my hurting envy of your appearance
I realize one littleness in my largeness. Absolute
admiration may endure only where envy may not spring.
Why does not Your Majesty seek that companionship which
is not born to jealousy? Isn’t there a complete assortment
of rags and bones and hanks of hair in Gehenna’s bargain
basement?”</p>

<p>“You suggest for me the companionship of&mdash;” Satan
paused briefly to sneer&mdash;“of a female shade? Don’t you
suppose, if I cared for the sex, that I’d be running a harem
of all nations, stocked with every famed siren, from Helen of
Troy forwards and back? You should know by this time,
old weakling, that your spirit in women doesn’t appeal to me
any more than to mortal profligates. And the pulchritude of
most has gone by the time they get here.”</p>

<p>“But there are the dewy-looking souls loitering about
the Fields. Why not break the rule that there may be no
transference between Elysium and the Lower Land before
the Call? Aren’t you the exception to all rules? Why not
an adventure for Your Excellency such as often we have
seen in the cinemized episodes of modern villains&mdash;an abduction,
say, of the most visible and fair before the guards can
interfere? Don’t despise my idea, generated from a conviction
that the chief lack in your life is loneliness.”</p>

<p>“An angel for me?” Mirthlessly His Highness laughed.
“Sir Sin, they bore me limp as a summer-resort collar. To
be sure that a she-soul is going to be eternally good is a fraction
worse than to be sure she’ll be eternally bad. No, philanderer,
you’ll have to do better than that. There is not a
female, quick or dead, for whose absolute admiration I’d
give a plugged nickel.”</p>

<p>The click of the door-knocker punctuated this assertion.
Satan strode to the throne; replaced his crown; signaled the
minister to respond.</p>

<p>Soon Sin bowed low before his Master, a look of evil
animation on his face.</p>

<p>“Already the Seven have returned, Sire. They report
that a goodly number of bad ones were crowding through
the gates. Among others, they interviewed a couple who,
they thought, may interest Your Majesty. They await your
pleasure without.”</p>

<p>“May divert My Majesty from complaint of them, you
mean. Yet I suppose that they, as well as you, should have
that proverbial last chance due evil intenders. By no means
make any diverting shade await my displeasure. Page, bid
them enter The Presence.”</p>

<p>Royal tolerance fled, however, at sight of the candidates.</p>

<p>“A crippled old soldier and a woman with a suckling
babe! It behooves me to find some way of revising the
current notion of what constitutes My Majesty’s diversion.”</p>

<p>He relapsed into silence as the new-comers were half led,
half dragged toward the dais by a pair of the scrub-oak
dwarfs who ushered inside the Gehennan gates. By light
of the dynamo that is within each soul, they were clothed as
in the habiliments they had worn in their late estate on
earth, he in a rusty uniform, she in nun’s gray. With his
crutch the cripple resented their intent to be rough, but his
travel-mate stumbled forward without resistance, her head
drooped so low that her long, loose hair swaddled the whimpering
infant shade in her arms.</p>

<p>The kingly choler increased when, at the steps, she sank
as though from exhaustion rather than reverence to her
knees. One last, promising glare he shot at Old Original
and the seven, then spoke in a voice quiet, yet more dire
to those who knew him than any thunder-clap.</p>

<p>“To swoon, madam or miss, is out of date down here. I
pray you postpone the attempt for some less sophisticated
audience.”</p>

<p>Sin, leaning forward from his especial chair just back of
the throne, dared to insinuate: “And I pray you, Damnity,
do not sentence her until you have considered her. There is
something exceptional about her. She may have been sent
to prove that idea of mine.”</p>

<p>Satan scorned to notice the suggestion.</p>

<p>“Come,” he ordered the woman soul, “show your passport.”</p>

<p>As though from shame, she crumpled against her breast
a scarlet slip. Shaking back her hair, she looked up at
him.</p>

<p>His Highness, startled, returned her look. He did not
heed or hear Sin’s gasp of anticipation. He forgot the
seven, the pages and the dwarfs. Leaning lower, he looked
and looked.</p>

<p>Truly he, who had been the fate of most fair women
since Eve, never had beheld one of a face of such appeal.</p>

</div>

<p>The multiple-candle glow from the Mephistophelian coat-of-arms
lit the girl-soul’s features. From a veil that well
might have been worn on Earth for mourning, so black
was her hair and enveloping, they gleamed as if carved from
Parian marble. The curve of her chin, the fullness of lips
blent into faint, downward-traced lines, the tube-rose texture
of her cheeks, all lent a suggestion of pliancy, even
weakness. Above, her classic nose and broad forehead
offered contradiction&mdash;were sculped as from a master’s
inspiration.</p>

<p>Lesser wonders as to the personality behind the marble
mask merged into that aroused by her eyes. Colored like
the purpling depths of a midnight sky, they concealed, rather
than revealed. From beneath straight brows they gazed
forth, not as a hope that is lost in darkness, but as hope
resting from its weariness, to rise again at dawn. Over
her face they shed a light of mystery that made its beauty
negligible&mdash;a mystery based neither on courage nor fear,
pride nor shame, joy nor dole. They asked what confused
the mind and haunted the imagination, that demand of why&mdash;<i>why</i>&mdash;to
which only the Creator of souls Himself one day
may make satisfactory reply.</p>

<p>Intently as the spirit-girl studied the new arbiter of her
sorry fate was he studying her. At first he did not move.
Then the finger-tips of his one hand sought those of the
other. As they met, the ruby-red setting of his signet ring
discharged a spark.</p>

<p>“The sight of you sounds like some song of Destiny,”
said he.</p>

<p>“And only Destiny could be accountable for her present
plight.” The crippled soldier, handling his crutch with the
skill of long practice, approached the throne. His one heel
clicked against the floor in a salute peculiar to the wars of
yester-year. “Might I say a few words, sir, for this young
mother? I got to know her well on the awful journey into
Shadow Land.”</p>

<p>Satan, turning to him, saw that age had not blurred a
youthful eagerness in his parchment face and the faded blue
of his eyes.</p>

<p>“And why,” he scoffed, “should you speak a few words
for her, or a couple, or even one&mdash;you, a mere piece of a
man?”</p>

<p>“That you will know, sir, after you know her. A mere
girl she is. Nothing truthful, I’m sure, could be written
against her account in the records of Earth.”</p>

<p>“You evade my question.” Royal annoyance over the interruption
was turned from him to his sponsors. “Why, you
imperfect seven, a one-legged veteran of a past decade?”</p>

<p>The prime minister intervened. “Old One-leg here is not
so weak a new idea as he looks. While he has not fought
in the latest battles of Earth, he has been absorbed in them,
he says, and theoretically knows all there is to be known of
modern tactics.”</p>

<p>His Highness’ shoulders shrugged. “None can say that
I am not glad to believe the worst of every man. Has he a
passport?”</p>

<p>Aloud he read the soldier-shade’s card:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Samuel Cummings, N.C.O. In youth deserted when battle
was on. Changed his name and lost his identity for a time.
Later reënlisted, was wounded in service, but not distinguished.
Called from Soldier’s Home.”</p>
</div>

<p>The cripple’s free hand brushed one ear, as if forcefully
to eject the words. “I deserted, yes. But she lay sick abed,
my girl bride, and I loved her better than myself. Afterwards
not a man in our company fought more careless than
Corporal Sam. But we had a saying at the Home that you’ve
got to be conscripted into the army of death. Only cowards
volunteer.”</p>

<p>“Once a deserter, always one,” His Highness made
remark. “Don’t you see that more important affairs than
yours await? Just remember this, no wife is worth deserting
a good fight for.”</p>

<p>Corporal Sam, with head sagging and shoulders disturbed
by more than his crutch, stepped aside. But a wonderful
light shone from his blue eyes into the Satanic gray ones.</p>

<p>“I know,” he muttered, “that what made my Mary Gertrude
worth deserting for can’t ever die. I saw her in the
border fields this very evening. She couldn’t go on, you see,
without me. She had promised to wait around for me
until&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence, old nuisance,” Sin advised. “One doesn’t mention
the Second Call in The Presence.”</p>

<p>He need not have feared. His Majesty’s attention had
returned to the girl-shade. A long moment he studied her;
closed his eyes; quickly opened them to study her again.
The puzzlement at first on his features changed to semi-recognition.</p>

<p>“That look in your eyes&mdash;&mdash; What is it, that look? I seem
to know you, woman, although I cannot place you. Do you
remember having seen me before?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that I ever have seen you. But I’ve known
men on Earth that resembled you.” Her voice was that of a
cathedral bell retarding over the last phrase of the hymn.</p>

<p>“It must be that I have trailed you afar, probably at the
start of the career that brought you here. Let us see how
you’re written down in Mors’ copy from the book.”</p>

<p>Sin transferred the card from her clutch. With characteristic
bravado, he read the start of it aloud.</p>

<p>“Dolores Trent, Grief to Men, and bastard babe.”</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” With unwonted eagerness, Satan
possessed himself of the passport. “That is quite a title,
‘Grief to Men.’ I like it.”</p>

<p>He smiled peculiarly while giving his eyes to Earth’s
verdict of the newcomer, as transcribed from that tome
called “Judgments of Men” which is in charge of Mors,
keeper of the Great Gates into Shadow Land. From between
the two lines of his strong, white teeth, his tongue
appeared and smoothed both lips.</p>

<p>The girl-soul, with the equivocal expression of one both
fascinated and repulsed, watched him as he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dolores Trent, known as ‘Grief to Men.’ A cause of disaster
from first breath to last. Her birth caused the death of her
mother, whose loss brought her father to ruin. Directly responsible
is she held for the wrecked careers of a successful
merchant, an eminent Divine, a skilled healer, a previously exemplary
millionaire, and an attorney of repute. As a climax,
the supreme crime of womanhood is hers&mdash;an illegitimate child.
Through life she has spread sorrow in her wake. Unto death
she carries her murdered ill-begot, a suicide without repentance
or appeal.”</p>
</div>

<p>The King commented: “Æons have come and gone since
I have felt surprise. Completely did that look of yours
deceive me. And Raphael must have altered the face of his
Madonna had he first seen yours.”</p>

<p>Arising, he stepped from the dais, settled his crown a
trifle more to one side and slicked his vandyke with meticulous
care. He then approached the cowering figure on the
steps.</p>

<p>“It is unseemly that you should remain upon your knees,
madam or miss, when many stand who probably are not half
so bad as you. Allow me.”</p>

<p>Stooping, he lifted her to her feet.</p>

<p>She straightened to face him with a show of bravery.</p>

<p>“I was misunderstood on Earth,” she said. “In this
existence, I hope for justice.”</p>

<p>“Fear not,” he assured her. “In Gehenna you shall receive
justice, Dolores Trent, as meted by that world which has
learned you to its sorrow and, it would seem, to your own.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you&mdash;I swear to you, sir, that I have done no man
willing wrong.”</p>

<p>He greeted her protest with a punctilious laugh, as though
over an attempt at wit.</p>

<p>“Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you will not punish my baby for my faults?” A
breeze of terror swung the cathedral bell. “Only look at
her, sir. She is too tiny, you see, for the vaguest thought
of wrong. To her, at least, be merciful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hell, be merciful!” Satan mocked her. “That too-late
wail has been dinned into my ears until it is a wonder
that I can hear you at all. Cheer up. You won’t have to
part from it&mdash;I beg its pardon&mdash;<i>her</i>. Have you not heard
that a child conceived in sin must take his&mdash;its chances with
her progenitors?”</p>

<p>At the low, protesting cry which escaped the mother, he
laid a hand on her shoulder, then allowed his arm to settle
about her, as though measuring her height by his own. His
touch appeared to repulse her. Shuddering, she passed the
infant shade to the other arm and stood irresolute, evidently
trying to decide how best she might release herself.</p>

<p>A commotion at the door claimed the court’s attention.
Through the light-striped hangings, slipping from the grip
of the pygmies, two comely creatures seemed verily to float
across the throne-room, a youth costumed as a knight and
a guileless-looking maid. He, drawing her by the hand,
pressed toward the group before the dais. Lithe of body and
ardent of eye, he caught the arm of the King and sought to
remove it from about the suppliant’s form. As the pursuing
dwarfs seized him with their over-long reach, His Highness
found himself looking down into the flower-face of the girl
intruder&mdash;into eyes shy and fearless as violets at dawn.</p>

<p>“And whom,” he enquired, “have we here?”</p>

<p>The minister undertook to announce them. “A pair by
the stagy names of Innocentia and Amor. They call themselves
guardian spirits and have a talent, which few share
with Your Excellency and myself, of absolute invisibility.
They lined up in a most theatric way beside the wench
Dolores outside the door. As they had no passports and
did not seem to belong, I sent them back&mdash;or thought I
did.”</p>

<p>Satan considered Sin and them. “Where is your sense of
humor, Old Original, that you explain them to <i>me</i>? I can’t
say that I should have regretted Amor. We have all varieties
of him down the Lane of Labors. But Innocentia! You
might have appreciated that I seldom get a chance to see her
wings flutter or hear her heart beat from fear. Tell me, you
two, what madness is driving you?”</p>

<p>“There has been some mistake about the girl Dolores,”
Amor declared. “Earth has passed another false judgment.
Shouldn’t I know who have been with her since first she met
the father of her child?”</p>

<p>“You refer, I presume, to her husband?”</p>

<p>The love-lad’s head threw back in defiance at the jibe. But
Innocentia flushed as she took up the defense.</p>

<p>“I have been with our dear Dolores always, more a part
of her than the blood in her veins, since that has ceased to
flow and I am come with her into Shadow Land. She has
heeded all my cautions against the wiles of men. Never
once has she offended me.”</p>

<p>“More sinned against than sinning, eh?” His Highness
plucked an imaginary tear from one eye. “Often as a
woman has been damned have I heard that plea.”</p>

<p>“Only see for yourself, Sire, how she shrinks from your
touch&mdash;how she suffers. We pray you, release her.”</p>

<p>“Little pest, don’t you know that I enjoy defying you?”</p>

<p>Even as he scoffed, however, his clasp of the mother
relaxed. He ascended the steps and reseated himself in the
throne chair.</p>

<p>“Innocence and love&mdash;certainly a strange companionship,”
he observed. “Odd that they don’t fade out, when they are
less material than the dimmest spirit in the inter-world.
Shoo them back whence they came, ushers. We must get to
the case in hand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg you, sir, let them stay!” Dolores interceded.
“You’ll find that they enter and exit quietly as thoughts
of the mind.”</p>

<p>“Thoughts of the mind get very much in my way,” Satan
snapped.</p>

<p>At his show of impatience, Innocentia pressed her lips
to the cheeks of the babe. “Do not distress yourself,
Dolores dear. It is best that we should disappear. But in
Gehenna, as on Earth and in the Fields, we see no gates and
acknowledge no commands.”</p>

<p>“Always remember,” Amor added, “the great love of John
Cabot. Send him the strength of your good faith. In your
late life it did seem that he forsook you. But when he
comes to the mystery world, he will seek you, never fear.”</p>

<p>“I shall remember,” Dolores assured them in a low aside.
“That night we said our vows, I swore that I believed.
Despite appearances, Amor, I do&mdash;I <i>must</i> believe.”</p>

<p>Old Original approached them. “Why unwind these fare-ye-wells
when your taxi’s waiting? Accept my arm to the
door, Miss Innocentia. You look almost overcome.”</p>

<p>Waggishly he escorted her out.</p>

<p>The while His Majesty’s frown lowered to the pygmean
pair salaaming before the dais.</p>

<p>As in one whine they put the formal demand: “To what
futile labors, O King, shall we consign these recruits?”</p>

<p>Satan shaded his eyes with one hand. He appeared not
to be thinking so much as looking. As if from under a
blower, the inflammable imagination of him glowed&mdash;glowed
on Dolores Trent.</p>

<p>The prime minister, on returning, settled in his chair and
claimed the keen ear which, through ages past, had considered
his suggestions.</p>

<p>“This modern Delilah, Excellency, I consider unique in
that she cannot be classed by the naked eye. She is not, so
to speak, a type. Might I call your attention to the tact with
which she maintains silence, while you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You might not. I detest to have fine bits of the play
diagramed by my seat-mate. Have I or have I not eyes
of my own?”</p>

<p>“But, Sire&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But the buts! Haven’t I paid at least as much admission
as you?”</p>

<p>All eyes focused upon the Master, except those of the
ancient hypocrite. His settled appreciatively upon her who
indeed had distracted the royal resentment from himself.
The pause which lapsed he had the temerity to break,
although in a vague voice, as if to himself:</p>

<p>“Hell to be lonely.... Some sympathy soul.... Boss
looker like you.... Try anything once or twice.”</p>

<p>“Try anything once and forever except hoodwinking me.”</p>

<p>If Sin’s pride was hurt by the King’s public rebuke, it
must have been salved next moment with the proof that his
advice was being found tenable.</p>

<p>His Highness to the court: “As a bad lot, this earthling
pair would seem to deserve labors different from any yet
devised. Until I decide upon some special form of punishment
I shall keep them in the palace. Dame Dolores comes
highly recommended to my ingenuity. That I may observe
her vices, I appoint her for the nonce First Royal Entertainer.
She shall relate to me those griefs which she has
caused on Earth.”</p>

<p>His glance veered to the veteran.</p>

<p>“Always have I envied the angels their ability to weep&mdash;never
have lived down the ambition to emulate their pietism
with just one tear. Mayhap I shall be moved to that extent
by these earth-tales of Grief to Men. I am <i>so</i> temperamental.
In view of which possibility, Samuel Cummings, I
hereby create for you the office of Holder of the Crocodile
Tear Bowl to my Majesty. As for the bastard babe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dolores, at his flint-hard gaze, clutched closer the tiny
soul of her soul. Intensely she awaited his words.</p>

<p>“Don’t crucify yourself with maternal fears, my beauty.
We are pleased to let the Littlest Devil stick around. Ever
notice how the strongest villain has weakness for a brat?
Yours is about as young as they come&mdash;almost a native, one
might say. He will give the palace a homey look.”</p>

<p>“She, sir.”</p>

<p>“<i>She.</i> I beg <i>its</i> pardon.”</p>

<p>“You are so much kinder than I was led to expect.” To
his consideration the young mother lifted the radium glow
of her gratitude. “From hints I heard at the Mystery Gate,
I gathered that you were&mdash;that you might be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The delicacy of such comment was impressed upon her by
the interested expression of its subject. As she paused in
confusion, a Balialic smile lightened his countenance.</p>

<p>“Beginning on me already, sweet Grief&mdash;and with the
old baby-eyed confidence game? Even so, you are different
from the rest of the damned Delilahs.”</p>

<p>Unexpectedly he clapped his hands. Invective, sarcasm
and abuse greeted the courtiers and pages who sprang to
receive and execute his orders.</p>

<p>“Get the machinery of this court geared up, will you?
Light the snuffed lucifers that are supposed to illuminate
my life. Affairs in general are going to be run more according
to the ways of Earth, or certain helliots will be put
through their third and last degree before their appointed
time. You, tell that new chef that I have some few untried
torments for him if he does not excel his predecessors
to-night. He’s to prepare a banquet that will taste as well
as look. Dynobasco Sauce for my burnt-out stomach, the
mead that sears to wash it down&mdash;all the trimmings. And
you, tell the head landscape gardener that I want moonlight
to-night&mdash;gobs of it&mdash;and a free play of juice through the
Garden of Bad Luck. Have him throw the limit in effect&mdash;fountains
and foliage and tropical bloom. I want the mistress
of royal robes paged at once. Wonderful electrician
though she is, she hasn’t had a worthwhile order since Cleopatra
cast me for Anthony II. in a little domestic drama
whose tragic last act rather overbalanced the light lines of
the start. We shall see what her genius at fabric effects can
do for this trail-worn lady. Remind her of how Shakespeare
once remarked: ‘Glad rags don’t spoil the work of
any tragedienne.’”</p>

<p>The crook of a royal finger brought Old Original to his
side.</p>

<p>“Sin, I wish you personally to see to the selection of a
suitable tear-bowl. Take care that it is polished. Our
electro-silver plate tarnishes so quickly from its own heat.
And make sure it doesn’t leak. My first crocodile tear must
be preserved&mdash;a glittering trophy to adorn the filet of
m’lady Grief. Now begone, all of you. The biggest little
séance since Creation is going to commence to-night.”</p>

<p>Alone, to his reflection in the mirror, he telepathed:</p>

<p>“I know that she is different from the different effect on
me. Because I don’t doubt that she’s bad, I don’t dislike
her looking good. She is unique, this Dame Dolores. I
may be able to use her. Should I approve her method in
those troubles she caused on Earth, I just might show her
some larger responsibilities.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Through the seven courses of that most remarkable of
feasts, the spirit-girl Dolores exerted herself to please their
Satanic host, for sake of her babe if not herself. Splendid
beyond words was his appearance, from his scintillant crown
to the hem of a mantle charged to imitate iridescent metal
cloth. Corporal Sam Cummings she scarcely had recognized,
so changed was he by the steel-scaled costume of an
old-time knight in which he came arrayed, a veritable “armour
of light.”</p>

<p>Without vanity, she appreciated the kindly soldier-soul’s
gasp at first sight of her, having herself been surprised by
the achievement of the mistress of robes.</p>

<p>A twist of green flame bound her hair and suspended one
large drop, like an emerald of great price, low upon her
brow. The rays of her body garment clung close, representing
a material sewn through with threads of gold. This
fell only to her pearl-roped ankles, but a long cloak of
translucent green waved behind her when she moved, like
the following billows of the sea.</p>

<p>Her beauty she had learned to deplore. To-night she
feared it. Something worse than admiration had shone in
the lurid gaze of the prime minister and lesser courtier
demons, something disturbing in the silent, critical inspection
of His Highness.</p>

<p>Gracious enough had been Satan’s manner. Not until he
sampled the last course of the delusive seven did his irritation
break bounds. He demanded the presence of the first chef.</p>

<p>“What was my last promise if you didn’t concoct something
I could taste?” he demanded of that unworthy. “Why
do you suppose I had you heat-tormented to suicide in the
<i>Brillon</i> kitchens in Paris if I didn’t expect you to do better
by me gastronomically than your predecessors? I have been
improvising tortures for cook-soul failures for more centuries
than the blades of near-grass used to tint this pistache
ice. Bah, heats me to look at it! Soon as I can replace
you, into the hole for Traitors to Mothers you drop.”</p>

<p>The wretch wrung his hands. “Not there, your Majesty!
I loved my <i>mère</i>. And is not my present labor futile
enough? Almost do I despair of tempting the palate of an
immortal, with nothing but chimeras as ingredients&mdash;with
flour of the bleached dust of hopes and paprika and baking-powder
of imaginary ground brick or brimstone.”</p>

<p>“I do not grant that your labor is futile,” Satan snapped.
“Surely you’ll agree that the Ruler of Greater Gehenna deserves
the Epicurean joys afforded gluttonous nobodies of
Earth? I want to <i>eat</i>, I tell you. Of course I am more or
less immaterial. Every soul in Shadow Land is, the new-comers
less, the old-timers more. But the appetites of
Earth appeal more to me than the self-sufficiency of the
angels. I intend to have them&mdash;and to have them satisfied.
If by to-morrow you have not risen to the concoction of
something to tempt me, into the hole for Traitors to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>With what sincerity she could assume, Dolores interposed.
“I am sure I never tasted a more delicious pasty.”</p>

<p>“Is that true? Can you <i>taste</i> it?”</p>

<p>Satan’s gaze was upon her with the questions, his expression
more than wontedly repulsive from greed. Then wrath
at her caught him.</p>

<p>“Liars are to be commended in a bad cause, but <i>pitiers</i>!
You must conquer such impulses. Acknowledge that you
have experienced only the vaguest reminiscence of taste.
Come, let us leave this farce of a feast. I have chosen my
Chamber of Chance as the most fit setting for your tale of
the game of life. Lady champion of griefs, precede me.”</p>

<p>He pushed back from the table. The attendants scrambled
after his example. The head butler turned Dolores’
chair. She found herself sweeping past the demon parasites,
then past His Majesty, standing with head bent and
hand on heart, a derisive smile upon his face. A page, at a
gesture of the King, gathered up the phosphorescent billows
of her mantle.</p>

<p>She fell into the accent of certain strains of music which
were playing a dim, yet definite march of the dead. No
ocean ever sobbed more sympathetic plaint. No snarl of
fife or beat of drum ever timed sterner step. The music
between two spheres&mdash;had Handel heard it in his dream of
Saul?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Royal Entertainer was placed in the strongest light at
a faro table which centered a room black-hung and artistically
dimmed for the occasion. Satan sat opposite as a mere
auditor, his eyes glowing like lit lamps from the shadow.</p>

<p>“A hint or two or three before you begin,” said he.
“Remember that the story’s the thing. If it doesn’t grip,
aside from the fact that you are telling it, you’ll have failed
in your art. You’ve read some of the old-fashioned French
novels, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Sire, and in the original. My father was a
translator and taught me to read in several languages,
French, Russian, Spanish&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t all that come in the story? Don’t insult our
intelligence with repetitions. Try to emulate the speed of
modern fictionists, with the&mdash;shall we say the slow-mindedness
of the old? And leave out the asterisks. We who have
crossed into Mystery Land have every right to know what’s
behind the stars.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;&mdash;” she faltered.</p>

<p>“In brief, this: give us a tale with style, but all passages
that should be expurgated left in.”</p>

<p>Dolores, confused rather than enlightened by these specifications,
essayed her earth-life story with what sprightliness
she might.</p>

<p>“You know New York City?”</p>

<p>“Do I know New York&mdash;I who invented it?”</p>

<p>Her start was fortuitous; although not intended to be
humorous, won the tribute of a chuckle from him at the
head of the narrow monk table.</p>

<p>“Since you know New York, King Satan&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Call me Pluto,” suggested he. “It is my friendliest
name.”</p>

<p>“King Pluto”&mdash;she gave him a smileless nod of agreement&mdash;“you
doubtless have heard of Harlem flats?”</p>

<p>Again he chuckled. “Some of our best little badger games,
jealousies, murders and other such trivial offenses have been
conceived and executed in Harlem flats. Eh, old Original?
We call them ‘incubators of discontent.’ I have visited a
few in person on special occasions, although generally one of
the under-demons proves bad enough to start the regular
Harlem crimes. The <i>Boulevard des Capucines</i>, Piccadilly,
<i>Unter den Linden</i>, the <i>Corso</i> and a narrow street called
Wall are more usual haunts of mine, offering, as they do,
larger opportunities. But this side-issuance is against the
rules. Assume that I am fairly well acquainted with the
cubbies of modern cliff-dwellers.”</p>

<p>“They named me ‘Grief to Men,’ yet I have not meant to
be. To explain how the cruel title came to be forced upon
me, I must begin in a Harlem flat at about my nineteenth
year.”</p>

<p>With the tremors of a spent swimmer forced to greater
effort against the tide, Dolores breasted her tale. Through
that evening’s recital and through those of subsequent
evenings, she sought to make of herself a mere entertainer, to
remember the “style” demanded, as learned from the border-line
literature of the several tongues at her command, to
conquer her reluctance and lay bare the facts which had been
deemed worthy of so much space in the newspapers of
Earth&mdash;for sake of those whom indirectly she was protecting,
to tell her tale with aptitude as impersonal as though
its subject were not herself.</p>

<p>Yet in the telling came moments when her continuity
broke, when her desperate attempt was abandoned in something
more convincing than “style.” Conquered by emotions
which had come with her from the mortal world to this
strange beyond&mdash;emotions of reverence, of love, of passion,
of shame&mdash;she would fall silent, unable to proceed. At such
times her hands would shield her eyes, while the shudders of
a modest spirit would plead for reprieve; her head droop
until her breast touched the board; her lips refuse for a
space to obey her will to divert.</p>

<p>Fortunately His Excellency, far from disapproving such
violations of the rules which he had imposed, appeared to
regard them as superstrokes of a talent patent from the
start. They lent to the reality of the tale, prolonged suspense
and multiplied his enjoyment in her sufferings. To him,
prone to delight in the inherent worst of devils and of men,
the words she could not force herself to utter often meant
more than those which had fallen from her lips.</p>

<p>Again, when his own impatience, increased by that of the
demon audience, stripped bare her soul and lashed her, with
malevolent threats, into renewed effort, he would chortle
aloud from satisfaction in his mental degeneracy.</p>

<p>From his infinite fund of information regarding persons
of importance whose trails had crossed the girl-soul’s own,
he was able frequently to furnish facts regarding others
when, at times, she failed.</p>

<p>The earth-story of Dolores Trent, free in version and
filled in from the super-supply of Satanic intelligence,
ensues.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h3>
</div>

<p>Close to five o’clock the decrepit vehicle which, with a
dingy hearse, had formed the funeral cortège of Trevor
Trent, creaked to a stop. The entrance to the Heartsease
Apartments gaped wide, just as it had gaped a few hours
earlier when the remains of the wastrel had passed through
for the last time. The relic of a Jehu, in crinkled topper and
faded blue livery sans buttons, lowered rheumatically from
his seat on the box. Adjusting his soiled dickey, mainstay
of a celluloid collar and green tie, he threw open the door
with what might have been taken for extra ceremony, had he
not verbally urged his passengers to hurry lest he miss the
hot free-lunch which, with the weak prohibition-time “suds”
that washed it down, was the most pleasureable event of his
day.</p>

<p>Those who alighted stood a moment in regretful silence&mdash;two
typical Harlem matrons, one with a child in arms, both
with offspring attached like lead weights to their skirts.
Between them was the girl whom they were seeing to-day,
through the goggles of sensation, in the stellar rôle of chief
mourner.</p>

<p>“Pore thing&mdash;pore young thing!”</p>

<p>Their tears, more or less sincere, vied with those of the
dripping heavens, although not tears for Trevor Trent.
Indeed, they who had known his life for the past seventeen
years had no apologies, even to the angels, for omitting to
weep over his demise. Their toil-dulled compassion went
out in this loneliest moment that succeeds a death to the
orphaned daughter who, hitherto, had been a detached unit
in their congested midst. A substantial escort, they ushered
her up the steps, unheeding the querulous welcome of the
young hopefuls left at home.</p>

<p>“Was it a long, good, joggly ride, Ma?”</p>

<p>“You mighta tooken us along.”</p>

<p>“Can <i>I</i> go next time anybody dies? ’Tain’t fair the baby
gets all the fun.”</p>

<p>Inside the door, the manner that belonged to an occasion
was unceremoniously doffed. Sympathy along this particular
block of the East One-Hundreds never interfered with life’s
practicalities. Dolores Trent received no invitations to sup
with her neighbors&mdash;expected none, since any superfluous
scraps could be served very well for breakfast.</p>

<p>Uneasy in the emptiness of the three rooms which for so
long had represented home to her, she settled at the oak
desk beside the window with intent of searching the close-printed
want columns of an evening paper. But at first she
could not see to read.</p>

<p>In this chair her father had struggled over the translations
from which their livelihood had been eked in those
better moments when the drug to which he was addicted
would permit him to work. That, of course, was before he
had lost the position through inaccuracies which made the
firm intolerant of trying her as substitute. In the corner
to the right squatted the couch upon which he had wasted
into that pallid, unresponsive thing so lately consigned to the
ground, despite her terrified efforts to stay his departure
and to recall him, once he had gone. How strange, how confusing
to be alone, like a flower cut from its bush and
thrown to the wind! It seemed as though she, too, must
wither and die.</p>

<p>Over him toward the last had come a change which already
was dear to her memory. Always gentle with her, intermittently
zealous in an ambition to train her mind for some
worth-while future, he had become obsessed by an anxiety
over her which dulled him to the crave for poppy paste,
hitherto his controlling love and hate. It was something to
remember that, improvident though he had been in life,
paupered though he was leaving her, his distress over her
fate in these last days had conquered his desire for the
drug. In the dusk, his last words seemed again to rasp in
her ears.</p>

<p>“You have beauty and innocence, my girl. Please God a
good young love may protect you on your way!”</p>

<p>Although her eyes burned, no tears relieved them.
Although her heart near burst with longing to assure him
how, above other children, she had been grateful for his
affection, no whisper passed her lips. She could not reach
him now. Merely pitiful was her regret over the diffidence
which had kept her from telling him that, from her earliest
understanding, she had recognized his right to resent her;
had appreciated, on that very account, his tolerance.</p>

<p>But she must not regret. That would weaken her when
most she needed strength. Had she not done the best she
could? In her life-long defense of his habit, in the protectorate
over him which had been her chief concern from
childhood to this early maturity, had she not shown him that
she worshiped him for forgiving the crime she had committed
in being born&mdash;in making that brutal exaction of a life for a
life?</p>

<p>The poppy paste she never had criticized, realizing that it
had entered his life at the beginning of her own, when the
young mother who had died to give her birth lay stark, for
the first time unresponsive to his adoration. On that first
night of her existence, as often he had told her, he had
chosen her name as a sort of epitaph. Grief.... Grief....
That was what she had meant to him.</p>

<p>His improvidence she could not contemn, remembering the
brilliant career which, before her advent, had appeared to be
opening before him. Despite her lonely childhood, despite
the endurance which had filled her time in lieu of laughter
and play, she was glad now that always she had known.
With the full hurt of her heart she hoped that, if he had not
understood in life, he knew to-night that always&mdash;always&mdash;she
had known.</p>

<p>Darkness had taken possession of the room.</p>

<p>A thought that darkness possessed her prospects also
caused her to light the gas. She must not stumble into
the future. She must cease looking backward; must turn
and face forward. Determinedly she settled to the “Help
Wanted” columns, a hopeful array.</p>

<p>However, as she read through one after another of the
advertisements, down one column and up the next, the confidence
inspired by their numbers decreased. She had not
expected at once to sight an opportunity in which she might
utilize the somewhat haphazard learning with which she was
equipped. But she had hoped for something&mdash;<i>something</i> she
could do.</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>WANTED&mdash;Pretty, young girl of innocent type.
No experience necessary. Good pay to right person.
Apply Wednesday, 10:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, to <span class="smcap">Vincent
Seff</span>, &mdash;&mdash; Fifth Avenue.</p>
</div>

<p>In small type, with the reserve of opportunity, it stood
out from the rest. Dolores re-read it. “No experience
necessary.” That was the kindest thing said to her since
the cry of her father’s late-born anxiety: “You have beauty
and innocence, my girl.” The advertisement seemed addressed
to her.</p>

<p>As if in period to or amusement over her conclusions,
there sounded a gurgle from the gas meter. The vapor
flickered; sputtered; went out. Funerals, even in the East
One-Hundreds, are expensive. And the slot of the meter
never would have mistaken the single five cent piece remaining
in her purse for the quarter that was its exaction. In
darkness Dolores retired.</p>

<p>As she lay in her narrow white-iron bed, she saw in the
gloom, even more clearly than under the jet, that the want-ad
was meant for her. The signature had possessed, from first
glance, a familiar look. Vincent Seff ... Vincent Seff....
Could she have heard that name before?</p>

<p>With the first ray of gratuitous daylight, recognition
flooded her mind. Of course. Why shouldn’t it look
familiar, that name? Often had she glanced at it when
waiting around the corner to safeguard her father home
from the publishing house. In letters of brass, hammered
into an ebony plate, it identified the most alluring windows
along that highway of lures:</p>

<p class="center">
<big>VINCENT SEFF</big><br />
LINGERIE
</p>

<p>So there was work to be had at “good pay” handling
those costly, cobwebby under-garments which she, although
widely separated from them by circumstances, had paused
passionately to admire. So the proprietor of that house of
dear delights he was who wished to employ her, “without
experience,” if only she proved pretty and innocent enough!</p>

<p>Even after dawn “10:30 A. M.” seemed far distant. But
there was much to do toward vacating the flat. Already the
landlord had given her grace of three days and the new
tenants were “moving in.” Everything of value had gone to
the pawnbroker over on Lenox Avenue. The remnant of
furniture would be called for during the forenoon by the
junk man who had advanced her money for the funeral.</p>

<p>The Trevor Trent alligator suit-case, its original claims
to distinction contested by the years, she had retained for
her wardrobe and keepsakes. This, when packed, she carried
across the hall and left, “to be called for,” with one of
yesterday’s emergency mourners. After neatly sweeping the
floors as a wordless return for the un-landlordly lenience
shown her, she stood for one last moment on the threshold
of the living-room. Although no sound escaped her, there
rose from heart to quivering lips the wail of the young
animal bereft at once of parent and home.</p>

<p>Down at the corner a subway entrance suggested. The
estate of Trevor Trent was closed, his last obligation honorably
met. In the purse of his sole heir lay her legacy,
enough to carry her swiftly and at ease to the neighbor-hood
of her promised employment&mdash;promised to her by
Vincent Seff. She took out the lone coin and started for the
entrance.</p>

<p>An old friend, the Italian fruiterer, who yesterday had
eyed her with the impressionability of his race, stopped her
to press into her hand a luscious-looking, out-of-season nectarine.
Dolores tried to thank him, but choked on the words.
She decided to walk downtown. Without a clink, her
nickel slid into the coin-box at the corner of his cart, as if
fearful of being considered payment for this and other of
his kindnesses since her little girlhood. Dolores, too, was
fearful. She hoped the flush on her wontedly pale face
hadn’t made him suspect. At the corner she glanced back.
The old friend waved to her. Happily he had not heard;
had not seen.</p>

<p>Ten-fifteen.</p>

<p>Somewhat winded, she hurried her already stiff pace at
the warning of the church-tower clock on the cross-street
just above the lingerie establishment. The outer doors were
wide open and through the inner ones of plate glass she
could see gracefully dressed women clerks shaking out and
arranging their flimsy wares with a nice regard for effect.
As yet there looked to be no customers. But then, as
Dolores reminded herself, Vincent Seff’s was an ultra-fashionable
shop. The fine ladies destined to wear his creations
scarcely would be stirring beneath their satin and eider-down
at ten-fifteen A. M.</p>

<p>She was there. But even Father Time could not bully her
into entering at once. She found herself palpitating with
the uneasiness of one who, for the first time, offers her
services for wage. Three times she approached the door
before her courage bore her through.</p>

<p>Down the aisle a fashion-plate of a man stepped out to
meet her.</p>

<p>“May I direct mam’selle?”&mdash;he, in unctuous voice.</p>

<p>On realizing that she had been taken for a customer,
Dolores’ spirits lifted. She glanced hopefully down at her
threadbare blue serge suit. That daybreak pressing must
have rejuvenated it more than she had thought.</p>

<p>“I came in answer to this.” She produced the want-ad.</p>

<p>Insult was added to the floor-walker’s obvious sense of
injury when a woman clerk, elaborately coiffed, made comment
from the nearest counter:</p>

<p>“You might have guessed her as the one last victim for
Juke Seff’s slaughter of innocents.”</p>

<p>His face twisted in the very process of smiling. However,
he managed&mdash;and just in time&mdash;to frown.</p>

<p>“One flight up,” he said curtly to Dolores. “Turn to the
right and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To the wrong, deary,” corrected the coiffed clerk. “Then
go away, ’way back and down, down, <i>down</i>.”</p>

<p>Following directions, Dolores found herself in a large
room which appeared to be a modified sort of office, furnished
in gray wicker, with hangings of gray and purple
chintz. As every chair and settee was occupied, she backed
to the wall near the door. Surprised to see how many applicants
had preceded her, she began to make comparisons.</p>

<p>Every shade of complexion, from ash blond to raven-brunette,
was represented. Glancing among them, she might
have envied some their loveliness and fashionable clothes,
had she not so sincerely admired them. Like a flower garden
the aggregation looked and smelled, every girl contributing
her favorite color and perfume of sachet or extract to the
steam-heated air.</p>

<p>With all her appreciation, Dolores’ heart grew heavy. Gone
was her hope in the quiet distinction of her felt sailor hat,
gone her assurance that the advertisement was the sign-board
of Fate. Closer to the wall she shrank when, at precisely
half-after-ten, Vincent Seff entered the room.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h3>
</div>

<p>There was no mistaking him. None less than the owner
of the shop would enter with that assured step, and glance
among them with that odd mixture of aesthetic distaste, yet
business interest. His manner announced that they were
“goods” to him.</p>

<p>Seff was a man of certain attractions, somewhere in the
later thirties. Clothed in semi-belted homespun, his lines
were so defined as to suggest stays beneath. He was of
medium height, clean-shaved and almost pallid of face. His
brown hair he wore somewhat tousled, probably to hide its
scantiness over the crown.</p>

<p>By the time he had reached the center of the room, the
girls had straightened and begun to smile and chatter&mdash;all,
perhaps, except Dolores Trent. She watched him with the
detached interest of her dead hope.</p>

<p>Halting, he threw up his delicate hands in an affectation
of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dears!” he exclaimed, but in a voice lacking
animation. “I shouldn’t have believed there was so much
innocence in Gotham. Really, I am all but overcome.”</p>

<p>Despite the assertion, his eyes swept this corner and that.</p>

<p>“Would that I needed an army of innocents instead of
the one superlative!” He stepped to the open door on the
right. “Mrs. Hutton!” There was a click in his voice.</p>

<p>“Kindly be my board of elimination, Mary,” he instructed
the handsome, white-haired woman who responded. “This
galaxy of guilelessness is too much for little Vin. My alleged
discrimination is blinded, my business shrewdness reels, my
senses&mdash;&mdash; Yes, yes, I know that the lord of lingerie
shouldn’t have ’em, senses. But what can a mere man do?”
He laid one arm about her shoulders and leaned against her,
as if for support.</p>

<p>“Merer than man,” she said and, as though from dislike,
shrugged him off.</p>

<p>“Jealous again, dear heart?”</p>

<p>Although he had smiled with the question, her answer
made him flush.</p>

<p>“A sensible woman isn’t jealous of a thought.”</p>

<p>“Be good enough, by processes of detection best known
to your sex,” he instructed her more briskly, “to reduce this
bevy to five of the most natural. I’ll see them in the studio.”</p>

<p>Something additional he murmured into her ear.</p>

<p>She returned him a strange look.</p>

<p>“In twenty minutes I’ll show in the five,” said she competently.</p>

<p>The shop-man addressed the array of applicants. “You
will understand, young and pretty creatures, that refusal
implies no aspersion, either upon your looks or, shall I say,
your artful effect of artlessness. Unfortunately the house
of Seff can utilize but one of you and stern business commands
the selection of her best suited to our particular needs.
Thanks for the sight of each and all.”</p>

<p>With a winning smile, generally distributed, he bowed low,
backed to the chintz-curtained doorway through which he
had entered and disappeared into what, evidently, was the
studio.</p>

<p>Not once had his glance paused in the vicinity of Dolores
Trent. She, in complete reversal of last night’s concept of
a Fate especially interested in herself, lingered only to watch
proceedings.</p>

<p>The softer lines which had made Mrs. Hutton’s face
attractive disappeared with her employer. Sentiment evidently
was to have no place in these “processes of detection
best known to her sex.” She formed the seventy-odd applicants
in lines, before which she walked, looking each closely
in the face.</p>

<p>“Girls wearing rouge to this side of the room.”</p>

<p>No one moved. With women’s headiest hope, each evidently
relied upon the artistry of her make-up.</p>

<p>Mary Hutton again started along the lines. Authoritatively
she tapped this rose-blush blond and that brilliant
brunette.</p>

<p>To one who protested that she would not know how to
rouge: “You don’t need to tell me, my dear, anything self-evident.
You shouldn’t put so much in the center of your
cheeks. Natural color <i>spreads</i>. That’s the first lesson I give
our sales-girls. Start with a dab on the chin, next a suggestion
on your forehead between the eyes, then quite a bit
on the lobes of the ears, where all color starts. Only with
these high spots tinted to guide you can you hope for a
natural effect. When you’re going out, ask for my booklet,
‘If You Must Rouge, Rouge Right.’ They’ll give you a copy
free. Now, please, girls over twenty, fall out!”</p>

<p>Again hesitation, reproaches and complaints were met
with uncompromising firmness.</p>

<p>Dolores never understood how it happened, for long since
she had given up. She made no plea to Mrs. Hutton, nor did
Mrs. Hutton say anything in particular to her. In fact, if
the forewoman showed any notice of her other than of an
automaton, it looked to be dislike, not approval. Yet, at the
last, after the most impersonal of appraisals, she found herself
among the fittest five. As one, they were waved between
the curtains of gray and lavender chintz.</p>

<p>The “studio” might have been milady’s boudoir. Of violet
velvet were the carpets and hangings. The spindly Hepplewhite
furniture wore modulated tapestry. There was bric-a-brac
scattered about. On the walls hung etchings.</p>

<p>Vincent Seff had removed his homespun coat for a smoking
jacket of embroidered lavender silk, with which the more
delicate tone of his shirt and tie blended satisfyingly. He
did not rise as they entered; indeed, did not glance up for
several minutes afterward. He was lolling upon a <i>chaise
lounge</i>, at work over a drawing&mdash;some garment design, presumedly,
as he kept glancing at a rack beside him over which
hung several strips of sheer, vari-tinted fabrics.</p>

<p>With a sigh of reluctance he laid down the drawing-board,
selected a cigarette from a gold cigarette case and leisurely
lighted it. Only after several deep inhalations did he yield
his attention to the nervous bevy ranged before him. Pleasure
covered the regret on his face as he surveyed them. He
sat straight; studied them one by one.</p>

<p>“This <i>is</i> cruel&mdash;the most exquisite cruelty!” Aloud came
exclamation at last.</p>

<p>He reconsidered the stuffs on the rack. Leaning over, he
touched them.</p>

<p>“Beautiful, aren’t they? Surely the possession and feel
of such things should be enough&mdash;enough.”</p>

<p>His gaze, again shifting, fixed upon the pansy eyes of a
silver blonde whom, from the first, Dolores had admired
most.</p>

<p>“Come closer, Dresden shepardess,” he invited.</p>

<p>It was all over, settled, Dolores thought. Those defeated
should be the last to deny the <i>petite</i> creature’s claim to election,
so soft were the curves of her figure, so alluring her
tints of white, pink, blue and palest gold.</p>

<p>“Sorry to seem to disparage you, who deserve a kinder
fate,” Seff was saying. “You can see at a glance that your
complexion and hair are too indefinite to make for contrast
with these <i>crêpes</i>. Perhaps one day, for some other purpose&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His voice ebbed as does an outgoing tide. His attention
veered to the girl next in line, the most striking of the
natural brunettes from the outer room.</p>

<p>“My, my, but you are a luscious thing&mdash;a lovely, luscious
thing!” Seff’s delicate finger-tips touched together sensitively.
“I wish you to understand that, personally,
I like you red-blooded, dark ones&mdash;prefer you, in fact. But
you are too colorful for our present need. You’d make this
flesh pink look ashen. Awfully sorry, my dear. A thousand
thanks for the look at you. As for you, lithe gazelle&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The manner of his preface somehow foretold the fate of
the tall, willowy girl with nut-brown hair, fleeting flushes
and eyes like limpid pools, whom he next considered.</p>

<p>Dolores’ heart ached for the three thus gently dismissed.
She knew just how they felt. She would be the fourth to
go. Certainly, if they could not qualify, she should not feel
disappointment or offense. Except that her situation was so
desperate&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Go over to my friend Feldtbaum,” Seff continued. “See
if he can’t find a place for you in one of his roof shows. He
wants just the effect of spotless virtue which you give out&mdash;likes
it for punch. Somehow, for my purpose, you overlook
the part. And the next girl&mdash;she won’t do at all.”</p>

<p>His voice had sharpened.</p>

<p>Dolores almost leapt from the group, both hands hard
pressed against her heart to still its beat.</p>

<p>“Not you,” said the artist-merchant. “I’m speaking to the
fourth of you. Pretty face, young, innocent enough, but too
much bust&mdash;more like a matron. What I want to-day is&mdash;how
shall I express it?&mdash;the spirit of modest allurement.
You understand, each of you four, why you won’t do? I am
so sorry. I sincerely thank you. Good morning.”</p>

<p>Dazed was she who watched them go. Her one definite
thought was of the gas meter. How had it known when to
click off last night&mdash;how been even more sure than she that
the advertisement had been written for her?</p>

<p>“What am I to call you?” asked Vincent Seff when they
were alone.</p>

<p>“Dolores Trent is my name, sir.”</p>

<p>“Dolores? A sad little name. And you look to be a sad
little dame, sad and mysterious. That’s what gets me and all
the rest&mdash;mystery. Tell me&mdash;” his eyes lifted quizzically&mdash;“was
it your own idea to carry that symbol?”</p>

<p>“You mean this&mdash;this nectarine? An old friend gave it
to me as I was leaving home.”</p>

<p>Dolores realized with negligent surprise that the fruiterer’s
good-by gift was still clasped in one of her hands.</p>

<p>“A real nectarine, is it? I supposed it was artificial&mdash;meant
to be sort of emblematic&mdash;smooth, cool, not overly
ripe, yet with suggestions of pungency like, for instance,
yourself. That was too much to expect, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it was,” she admitted.</p>

<p>He continued to look at her. “Since you don’t claim
subtlety, perhaps I’d better confess that you were selected
before I went into the outer room. I looked over the flock
through the curtain.”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you did?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and advised Mrs. Hutton not to overlook you.”</p>

<p>“Then why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t I put the rest out of their misery at once?
Because I am said to be kind-hearted. The name of being
kind-hearted saves me money in getting employees. Then,
too, my business has taught me to flatter all women, rather
than offend them. Do you mind taking off your jacket,
Dolores?”</p>

<p>She answered by compliance.</p>

<p>Seff arose and stood a moment, stooping to peer into her
face. One hand he clasped around her right forearm and
slid it up to her shoulder, evidently measuring its proportions.
Then he tried the firmness of her busts.</p>

<p>Dolores did not like this, although she did not say so. She
swallowed against a pressure in her throat and longed for
her father as she had not longed hitherto. For the first time
she lifted her eyes to his.</p>

<p>He flushed; in another moment removed his hands. He
showed, however, to be pleased, that, from the eyes of the
applicant, had looked the attribute which was the chief
stipulation of his advertisement.</p>

<p>“You are not developed as you might be, but you may do
better on that very account,” he said, his manner professional.
“There’s a reason. I am sure we shall be good
friends.”</p>

<p>“I hope that I’ll be able to suit you.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of that.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I mean that I shall be able to do the work.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of that,” he repeated.</p>

<p>After helping her back into the serge coat, he stood off in
general contemplation of her, a pucker between his brows.</p>

<p>“Now, I don’t wish to hurt your feelings, Dolores, but
you’ll have to dress better right from the start. You don’t
care if I get down to business? Your salary will be twenty-five
dollars a week for the present. Later, if you fulfill my
expectations and don’t dun me, I’ll probably raise it. I am
going to pay you a week in advance and make you an
expense allowance of one hundred dollars. I of course pay
for extra clothes I order. I want you to go out and make
two purchases&mdash;first, one full-sized lunch, of which you look
in need; second, a new outfit. I shall not dictate that your
suit be gray, the color we affect in the store. But I advise
that it be quite plain, something along the lines of what you
have on, only of better material. Don’t scrimp in the quality,
will you?”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” she promised.</p>

<p>Drawing a leather folder from his breast pocket, Seff
sorted out six twenties and one five-dollar bill and handed
them to her.</p>

<p>Dolores took them, not knowing what to say. One hundred
and twenty-five dollars!</p>

<p>“You see that I trust you. Take the rest of to-day and
the early part of to-morrow to get yourself togged out,” he
further advised. “You may report to me here around noon-time.
I’ll explain then what your duties will be. Everything
satisfactory?”</p>

<p>“I wish I could thank you,” Dolores murmured, as she
stood waiting for him to turn the knob of the door.</p>

<p>“You can,” he said in his crisp way. “Give me the symbol.”</p>

<p>“The&mdash;this nectarine?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I want to sip it.”</p>

<p>She glanced up to see if he could be joking. But evidently
he was not. His eyes met hers, blue and serious as
a child’s. Yet she felt vaguely disturbed to notice that, as he
looked, the tip of his tongue appeared from between his
teeth and wiped both lips.</p>

<p>At once she gave him the nectarine. She was glad&mdash;so
very glad&mdash;that she had something he wanted to give him.
She told him so.</p>

<p>“You are, eh?”</p>

<p>He said no more to her by way of thanks. But she
caught several words of what he added, as if to himself:</p>

<p>“Sight, touch, the thought of taste. All&mdash;that is all.”</p>

<p>He did not answer when she told him good-by. With an
absorbed look he was turning the nectarine about in his
finger-tips. He seemed in no hurry to bite into it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To the best of her judgment, Dolores followed the instructions
of her first employer. She changed the five-dollar bill
in the purchase of luncheon, for she was, indeed, very hungry.
Even the reminder that she now must eat all her meals
alone, did not dull the edge of her appetite. It did, however,
decide that the color of her new suit should be black&mdash;the
only sign she might make of the desolation in her heart.
Mr. Seff might not like it. Still he had said that he was
“kind-hearted.” He would condone when he understood.
It should have the “quality” which had been his one proviso&mdash;all
the quality she could pay for after she had deducted a
week’s room-rent in advance and a sufficient sum for food
and incidentals.</p>

<p>The room she sought first as the less particular purchase
and found easily&mdash;a clean hall bedroom in the “refined
adult” district of the middle West Forties. The lesser
details of her “outfit”&mdash;a small hat, gloves, stockings and
shoes&mdash;she acquired one by one. The suit she did not decide
upon until ten o’clock the next morning when, conscious of
the clock hands and the obligations of good taste thrust upon
her, she exchanged her full residue for a tailor-made Duvetyn,
reduced, according to hearsay in the sample shop,
because of its “trying simplicity.” Holding her own opinion
superior to the many other ambitious things which the sales-woman
said about it, Dolores honestly felt that it was a suit
whose distinction of cut might offset, in Mr. Seff’s opinion,
its somber hue.</p>

<p>Attired in its unpretentious luxury, her hair done low on
her neck, as her father had liked it best, beneath her new
toque, she reported at eleven o’clock in the studio.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this point in the girl-shade’s recital, it was that she tore
her eyes from the expectant smile of Satan the First and
Last; covered her face from the hot gaze of others of her
demon audience; allowed her sprightly utterance to lapse
into shuddered lament.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I had known, if I had dreamed what I had been
paid-in-advance to do! If I could have understood in time
the stare of the floor-walker or the clerk’s reference to ‘the
Juke’s slaughter of innocents’! But the hundred dollars
was spent and he showed only surprise at my dismay. I
begged him to let me work out the money in some other
department of the store. But he said that even scrubbing
required experience. He had nothing else for a girl without
references to do.”</p>

<p>The King scowled. “You really have diverted me so far,
but your narrative style has slumped. It is an old trick,
fair fiend, that of pricking up the interest with exclamation
points.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t even a damned woman a right to some sacred
feelings?” Sin interposed.</p>

<p>“Even so, this is no confessional and I am no priest.
Queer my attention never was called to this lingerie lord.
He seems to be one of my own sort.”</p>

<p>As Dolores forced herself again to look at His Majesty,
she appreciated why his habit of wiping both lips with the
tip of his tongue had seemed odiously familiar.</p>

<p>“Have we no film in the Picture Storage Houses of the
machinations of one Vincent Seff?” With a threat in his
voice, Satan turned on the prime minister.</p>

<p>Sin met the implication with bravado. “Seff is only a
shopkeeper, Your Highness, a corking bad fellow, I know,
but not of especial importance. Our storage space is overcrowded
now with films of far worse than he.”</p>

<p>Satan’s frown blackened. “He sounds promising to me.
Should our Old Original be found guilty of another crime
of omission&mdash;&mdash; However, we are to hear more of Seff and
your maiden effort, are we not, sweet Grief? Pray proceed,
cutting out those alack-and-alas passages. We shall assume
that you were as innocent as your employer’s requirement at
high noon of that fatal day. It is a reasonable assumption
that everybody <i>is</i> innocent in life’s A. M., eh? At times I
take to pitying even myself for my state of innocuous naughtiness
before that little set-to with the Great-I-Am. Come
now, the tale&mdash;and see you give us the worst of it!”</p>

</div>

<p>From facts later learned, Dolores was able at this point
to shift the viewpoint of her earth story from performer to
audience. The incidents of that first morning’s payment in
service of her financial debt she presented through the eyes
of John Calvin Cabot, sole scion of a seventh generation of
New Yorkers and a financier who, through his inherent
aversion to idleness, was rated many times a millionaire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Cabots were late motoring down town, having been
detained at their upper Fifth Avenue home by a domestic
contretemps. The distress of it still hardened the lines of
the man’s somewhat grim-featured face. Through the
downward rush of many blocks, he pondered the first personal
favor he had considered asking his wife in years.</p>

<p>“Catherine,” he said at last, “I wish you’d come with me
to some toy shop and help in the selection.”</p>

<p>Catherine Cabot glanced into the limousine mirror, hung
near the vase of her favorite yellow orchids, “to double,” as
she put it, their beauty. She looked a good deal like the
orchids, golden-haired, delicate of outline, fragile of texture,
flower-eyed. John glanced into the mirror, too, rather than
straight at her. During their ten years together he had come
to prefer the reflection of his wife to the original. It was
softer.</p>

<p>“My day is so full. John, you order any toys you like.
Have them sent by special messenger.”</p>

<p>“You don’t get my idea, Catherine. Jack would be
touched and perhaps punished more than in any other way
for his outbreak this morning, if you selected a birthday
present for him yourself.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you tell him that I did, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I could, yes. But I won’t. I expected you’d suggest
that lie.”</p>

<p>“<i>John!</i> I sometimes think Jackie inherited his viciousness
straight from you.”</p>

<p>A moment the man considered this effective, if unconvincing
reproach of the mother of his only child.</p>

<p>“I wish you could feel some of my indignation over that
statement,” he made quiet comment. “Now and then you
have caprices for the most unique frankness I ever have
noticed in a woman. Tell me, do you have no yearnings
whatever over our unfortunate boy?”</p>

<p>She looked interested, as if at a compliment.</p>

<p>“I pride myself on my frankness. Of course any woman
has a natural affection for her own child. But, as you know,
I am a beauty lover. It is not my fault that I can’t love
Jack as I should if he looked like me, or even you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Catherine, he inherited something from you.
Perhaps he also is a beauty lover. Should you consider the
suggestion that the ‘viciousness’ you accredit to me may be
in him an extreme case of nerves&mdash;of a suffering over his
deformity older than you’d expect at eight years?”</p>

<p>She was thumbing the pages of her morocco-bound
engagement book and omitted to reply.</p>

<p>With a sadness too complete for contempt, he added:
“You often have wondered where Jack’s ugliness comes
from. I’ll tell you&mdash;from the ill-favored spirit of our
marriage.”</p>

<p>Catherine looked startled. Then she looked indignant.
After that, with a sigh of long-sufferance, she looked very
sweet.</p>

<p>In a voice gentle as his had been&mdash;“Since you take my
refusal so hard as to resort to your semi-occasional marital
recriminations, <i>dear</i> John, I’ll yield. I will go with you to
the toy-shop, although probably I’ll have to break a luncheon
engagement in consequence. You can’t ever say that I am
unwilling to do my part. Just a minute until I see what I
have on to-day.”</p>

<p>Soon and coaxingly she glanced up at him. Her upper
lip shortened over mouse-like teeth which gleamed, sharp
and white, between their crimson guards. Even with the
husband who claimed to know her, Catherine never was
chary of her ingenuous, confiding smiles.</p>

<p>“It’s your turn to make a concession. On our way to the
toy-shop, stop in with me at a showing of underwear at
Seff’s. It lasts only from twelve to one and I’ll miss it if I go
further down town. Even puritanical you may be amused.
Seff is rather sensational in his advertising, but he does import
lovely things. Here is the invitation for the latest of his
shows. Do you mind?”</p>

<p>She handed him a card, engraved and dictioned in the very
best form. She looked rather pleased than otherwise at the
manner of her husband’s consent.</p>

<p>“How like you, Catherine, to make your concessions
C. O. D.! For Jack’s sake, I shall try not to ‘mind.’”</p>

<p>A flutter of interest greeted the Cabot’s appearance on the
top floor of the lingerie establishment, for no more discussed
pair trod the made-up scenery of the ways and
by-ways of Gotham’s rich.</p>

<p>Catherine, despite the irregularity of that short upper lip
and the tortured, metallic brilliancy of the yellow of her
hair and the demand for public notice made by her clothes,
often was pronounced the most beautiful matron “among
those present”; at least, always was conspicuous. To-day
her perquisitory air of excelling even her splendid mink
coat won her distinction in the fashionable gathering of many
women and a few men.</p>

<p>John&mdash;as his wife was given to explaining&mdash;she had married
for his looks. She called him the “handsomest unhandsome
man” she knew. Tall, clean-shaved, black-haired, with
dark eyes of a singular intensity, he wore a manner as unpretentious
as his clothes. This was heightened to-day by an air
of detachment from the enforced situation.</p>

<p>Above greetings and introductions, tintillated comment
over the setting of Seff’s top floor. Arranged as a miniature
auditorium, its rows of ashwood chairs faced a small stage,
equipped with footlights. Wrought on the gray velvet curtain
that concealed the exact nature of this adventure in
advertising was the title&mdash;</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">
THE LITTLE OLD LADY OF LORRAINE
</p>

<p>At the twelfth chime of a concealed clock, an orchestral
whisper of the <i>Marseillaise</i> caused the audience, creatures
of habit, to seek their places. John Cabot, although offended
as always by the commercialization of patriotism in cafés
and music halls and the like, stood in front of the prominent
chairs to which an usher had led his wife and himself.
Those about him also stood, if with treasonable sighs;
as the music died away relievedly sank into their chairs.</p>

<p>The curtain parted. Vincent Seff appeared and lifted the
right of his artistic hands.</p>

<p>“Patrons&mdash;may I say friends?” he began when their mannerly
palm-patting had ceased.</p>

<p>The silence of curiosity greeted his hesitant, yet pleasantly
delivered announcement. Only Mrs. Hutton understood
his need of courage, his desire for pseudo-sincerity.
Virulently though she appeared to condemn him, she evidently
wished him to succeed in this, his monster imposition.
She had poured the stiff drink which lubricated his voice to
that especial smoothness. She stood in the improvised wings,
an expression which would have defied a mental analyst
hardening her face, as she listened to the delivery of the brief
speech which she had helped him prepare.</p>

<p>“Always have we admired the lingerie from Lorraine,
you and I. But how many of you have stopped to wonder
whose hands are responsible for its textile exquisiteness, its
chic and the needlework that makes it more lovely than any
other in the world? With the many changes which war has
wrought, came the fear that our American fair would be
reduced to less attractive underwear. Imagine, then, my
joy when there arrived recently, unsolicited and in trust, a
shipment from my little old lady of Lorraine.”</p>

<p>The speaker smiled upon the interested faces below in
humid, self-deprecatory appeal.</p>

<p>“The pluck as well as the embroidery of this maker was,
all through the war, a marvel to the trade. For weeks her
home was under enemy fire and the grand dame herself in
constant danger of her devoted life. But alone in her cellar
workshop she plied her needle as industriously as the <i>Boches</i>
laid down their shells. Such heroism swells the heart and
chokes the voice.”</p>

<p>After a brief substantiating pause, the shopman continued,
as if glorying in his show of emotion.</p>

<p>“Why did she do it? Not for herself, surely, since the
value of her work would have counted little against the loss
of her life. Patrons&mdash;friends&mdash;<i>she did it for France</i>. Every
mite that she earned was tossed into the coffers of her
country. And now that the reconstruction period is on, she
still finds work for her withered hands to do&mdash;still not for
herself&mdash;but for the war orphans of the French. Every cent
which this shipment yields will be spent on children whom
the great struggle has deprived of their natural protectors.
Not even a commission will be subtracted. No price has
been set upon the things which I am about to show you. I
feel that they are priceless. In the name of that little old lady
of Lorraine I shall give them to you for what you offer and
have no fear for the net results. To show them from boxes
on my counters&mdash;the mere thought has seemed unworthy the
trust placed in me. Will you try to like the more unique
method which I have devised?”</p>

<p>Bowing deeply and repeatedly in response to perfunctory
applause, Vincent Seff backed from view. Orchestral whispers
of the <i>Marche Lorraine</i> accompanied a flurry of exclamation.
The gray velvet curtain parted; lifted.</p>

<p>The set was a bedchamber. Through a half-open door
showed the suggestion of a tiled bathroom. Another door
and the two windows were closed. Once the eyes became
accustomed to the indeterminate light, they made out rare
hangings and furniture that looked to wear the stamp of
Louis XIV. Beneath the satin coverlet of the bed, an
elongated lump suggested a human figure asleep. Upon
one pillow a lace cap indicated rather than covered a mass of
murky hair.</p>

<p>For minutes the orchestral rendition of Schumann’s
<i>Traumerei</i> was the only action of the piece. In time the
pantomime of a morning’s awakening began&mdash;a shudder of
the coverlet, a stretching of legs beneath and rounded arms
above. The face which uplifted from its background of
locks and lace suggested a loathful emergence from dreams.
With some degree of energy a hand reached out and pressed
a bell. That accomplished, the luxurious sleeper slipped
beneath the eider-down and again drowsed off.</p>

<p>The entrance of a soft-treading, black-garbed, middle-aged
maid brought diversion. Her lips moved in a supposed
good-morning. She drew up the window blinds, flooding
the room with light. Her disappearance into the bathroom
was followed by the plash of water in a tub.</p>

<p>Her simulation of annoyance on returning to the bedside,
to find the dreamer reclaimed, was a nice histrionic bit. She
reminded; urged; finally shook. At last the lady of lethargy,
smiling deliciously, aroused to a sitting posture. The thrown
coverlet bared two rosy feet for the enclosure of satin
mules. She deserted the nest of the night, crossed the room
front stage and stood with arms uplifted as an aid to her
yawns.</p>

<p>The spotlight found her some seconds before the maid
could throw over her a bathrobe of silk so pliant that it might
have been drawn through a bracelet.</p>

<p>Inhalations and forward-leanings moved the audience.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was cause for comment. The daring of Seff
in his presentation, the novelty of the crêpe sleeping-gown
which, innocent of <i>filet</i> or ribbons, depended solely upon its
Empire lines and girdling silken cord&mdash;even the type of the
model was rare.</p>

<p>Pretty of face beyond question, with a luminous sort of
pallor, red lips delicately full and purplish, child-wide eyes,
she stood revealing through the sheer a body both slender
and rounded. Discussions of her as frank as they were low-pitched
proved that the pantomime was “taking” from the
start.</p>

<p>John Cabot was of the few who suppressed remark, but
none watching him could have doubted his interest.</p>

<p>Catherine curved an amused smile at him.</p>

<p>“<i>Et tu, Brute</i>,” she murmured.</p>

<p>At first from natural endowment and later from deliberate
effort, John always had believed in the virtue of women until
compelled to disbelieve. To-day he was studying neither the
exquisite, hand-stitched garment nor the “points” of the
manikin who wore it.</p>

<p>Had he really seen lines of suffering at the corners of that
smiling mouth? Had he imagined a look of distress in
eyes which momentarily had met, but now evaded his? He
was no sentimentalist. Yet he wondered.</p>

<p>Vincent Seff, from a chair at the far right of the first row,
looked entertained by his own entertainment. He sat
slouched forward, knees crossed, elbow on them, chin in
palm, eyes up-gazing. A flush was on his rather anaemic
skin. Occasionally his cheeks twitched in an odd, carefully
controlled smirk. He nodded, now and then, as if well
pleased.</p>

<p>John, glancing toward the shopman, saw the tip of his
tongue appear and wipe both lips. About Seff, too, he
wondered.</p>

<p>From the wings, Mrs. Hutton watched all&mdash;the play, the
“house,” the man who had conceived and perpetrated the
coup and the newspaper reporters upon whom he depended
to give it city-wide circulation. She, however, did not
wonder about Seff. Only too well she understood why he
was off guard at the moment, showing tendencies which,
ordinarily, his policy would have concealed.</p>

<p>She did not wonder, no. But she feared for him as much
as, with a reaction that crushed the fear, she hotly, contemptuously
resented him. As she studied the look fixed
upon the girl whom he had chosen at first glance from a room
full of attractive applicants, almost did she hate him. The
chains of the hideous relationship which shackled together
him and her seemed to clank as she turned from his unconscious
pantomime to that which he had foreplanned.</p>

<p>The playlet proceeded.</p>

<p>The model trailed her bath robe to the door of the tiled
room, there to throw it off and disappear within. Presumedly
she plunged into her tub. At any rate, her next
appearance, although fleeting, enhanced that impression.
Just a glimpse of her was caught, as the maid pushed wider
the door to supply a bath towel, but a glimpse that brought
gasps from the audience sharp as though they, too, had taken
a cold plunge.</p>

<p>With hair twisted in a Grecian knot atop her head, she
showed for the brief moment before the door was closed,
garbed only in the flimsiest of silken undervests. By comparison
she looked amply clad when, some seconds later, she
reëntered the bedroom, stockinged, slippered and girdled, her
outer garment a confection of the chemise persuasion which
laid claim to modesty only in its blush hue. The length lack
of this costume was remedied by the maid. After a chase
whose obvious object was further to show the cut and
texture of the display, the woman succeeded in noosing the
head of her charge with a hemstitched petticoat.</p>

<p>Upon the door sounded a knock of that portentiousness
met only on the stage. In effective dismay, the manikin
paused front stage, the spotlight obligingly following her
example. The maid, moved by belated prudery, scurried to
a closet, from which, after a search whose duration would
not have recommended her either for system or dispatch,
she emerged with a negligee that matched the morning
set. This she draped about her young mistress and stood
off to admire with a deliberation accented by repetitions of
the portentious knock.</p>

<p>When the door at last was opened, expectation of the
unusual was gainsaid by the man-servant who laid several
ribbon-bedizened boxes upon the couch and departed. Mistress
and maid became animated by curiosity. The parcels
were undone and their contents examined&mdash;a dozen sets of
lingerie only less lovely than the one worn by the model in
that they were less attractively displayed.</p>

<p>These still lay about the room on chairs, tables and bed
when, at entertainment’s end, Vincent Seff himself appeared
before the footlights. His face was noticeably flushed, his
voice thicker than before in his invitation that all ascend
the stage and personally inspect the shipment from Lorraine.</p>

<p>If applause meant appreciation, he must have been gratified.
And, in fact, the tribute was sincere. The hour’s advertising
whimsy had been amusing and artistic. Commendatory
chatter lifted as the spectators disturbed their chairs.</p>

<p>John Cabot was preoccupied by an analysis of the look
seen on the face of the master of ceremonies, a look which
had intensified as Seff studied, not so much the piece as the
star. Since a certain incidental which the financier had
noticed, the elaborate exhibition had become offensive to him.</p>

<p>In the manikin’s small tussle over the adjustment of her
petticoat, just when she had been laughing with most abandon,
two somethings&mdash;gleaming, small yet large in suggestion&mdash;had
dropped from her eyes and been absorbed by the
crêpe.</p>

<p>That she could weep for shame, while successfully playing
her frolicsome part, meant a great deal. Many young
girls might have wept before entering upon such a career.
Most could be imagined as weeping afterward. But to
realize and suffer enough for tears in what evidently was
an initial step&mdash;Although Catherine often had told John
that he was losing his sense of humor, nobody could have
declared him deficient in vision.</p>

<p>He was recalled to the immediate present by the lifted
voice of his wife addressing Seff.</p>

<p>“I will give five hundred dollars,” she was saying, “for the
set shown on the model. The things are exquisite and the
charity deserves response.”</p>

<p>“My <i>dear</i> Mrs. Cabot!” The shopman over-accented that
familiarity which the lofty seem so to appreciate from traffic-policemen,
waiters, hotel clerks and the like. “The identical
set is yours. I thank you from my heart and from the hearts
of those orphans of France.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take them with me,” stipulated Catherine. “Have the
box put in my car, please. And, Seff, I am in something of
a hurry.”</p>

<p>The crispness of her conclusion was like frost on a sunlit
window pane. The merchant showed himself nipped by it.</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to your order at once, Mrs. Cabot.”</p>

<p>Disregarding the importunities of less prominent would-be
purchasers, he hurried back to the stage.</p>

<p>“Mary&mdash;<i>Mary</i>!” His voice was pitched several notes
above its wonted mellifluence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hutton appeared.</p>

<p>“Take charge out here, Mary,” he directed. “Have the
ladies step up and examine the lot. Every garment has the
inimitable chic attained only by the French, and the sizes
vary, so that&mdash;&mdash; <i>You</i> know, Mary. Take anything that is
offered. Such patrons aren’t going to fail our lady of
Lorraine.”</p>

<p>Far too elated was he to notice the composite of his chief
aide’s expression as she observed his uneven manner, his
flushed face and the glitter of his eyes. In the same thought,
she sneered, pitied and suspected. She turned to attend the
gathering patrons.</p>

<p>Seff had not noticed, but another had. John Cabot had
followed to the stage and now stood contemplating the closed
door that gave upon the suppositious bathroom. Through
it the shopman had disappeared. A mental reminder that
the whole circumstance was doubtless gross chicanery and,
at the worst, none of his affair, seemed somehow dampened
by his memory of those two small, enlightening somethings
which he had seen drip from the eyes of a laughing girl.
From within he could hear fragments in Seff’s thick tones.</p>

<p>“A hit.... Five hundred for the set you adorn....
Let me help, you dream.... No time&mdash;she’s in a hurry....
I <i>will</i>.... Hush, dear heart, they’ll hear you.”</p>

<p>Ensued a duet of his chuckles and gasped protests in a
softer voice. The end unmistakably was a scuffle.</p>

<p>John turned away, disagreeably impressed. Many of the
fashionables had ascended the stage, where Mrs. Hutton was
offering the Seff confections for sale. He advised himself
that he must be imagining the alert turn of the forewoman’s
head toward the closed door and the annoyance that falsified
her smile. Then he flouted the advice. He didn’t imagine&mdash;<i>he
saw</i>. The woman <i>was</i> alert and annoyed.</p>

<p>The conclusion was substantiated. Sounds that might
have been laughter or sobs percolated through the key-hole.
Rasped gutterals interrupted, plead, threatened. There followed
a rushing sound and a thump against the inside of the
door.</p>

<p>John recrossed the stage. As he hesitated, he saw Mrs.
Hutton drop the garment under discussion and approach
him.</p>

<p>Next moment a scream rent all uncertainty.</p>

<p>The most cynical scarcely could have mistaken the cry
for anything but one of terror, even without the words&mdash;intense,
jumbled, regardless&mdash;that translated it.</p>

<p>“No.... <i>No</i>.... I hate you.... Father, help me&mdash;<i>save
me</i>!”</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Hutton could force the resisting handle of
the door, John Cabot had put his shoulder against the panel
and broken the lock.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h3>
</div>

<p>The scene within the back room of the bath-set impressed
John like a still on a film which had been full of action.
First glance might have convinced a superficial person that
intrusion was a mistake, but the financier was not limited to
first glances.</p>

<p>Leaning against the farther wall, her apparel reduced
to the flimsiest of the samples on recent display, stood the
manikin. Both her arms were upraised. Both hands clasped
the shoulders of Seff.</p>

<p>John glanced away; looked again; saw other things.</p>

<p>The girl was straining to push away the shopman, not
to draw him to her. In her eyes, uplifted at the crashing
of the door, was pictured the terror which had sounded
in her cry. Her face was white as frost&mdash;looked the whiter
for a mark, shaped after the imprint of teeth, which was
reddening in the flesh of her cheek.</p>

<p>Self’s one arm wrapped her body tightly. His other
hand was entangled in her flimsy garment at the breast.
His face, also turned toward the door, shuddered with an
absorbed, strange look between hope and hopelessness.</p>

<p>John Cabot stood on the threshold, held by astonishment.
He had heard that high prices oft times were exacted of
shopgirls, as of aspirants for the stage. But this situation
would have seemed incredible except that there it was
before his eyes. He felt a demand for initiative.</p>

<p>In that scant moment of hesitation, the pros and cons
of the issue, as concerned himself, flashed through his
mind. The principles in this behind-the-scenes passion play
were not of his class, or so Catherine would have said. Both
were total strangers to him, therefore their relationship
not his affair. More or less undesirable notoriety must
result from interference&mdash;the inevitable complement? to the
Cabot millions.</p>

<p>However, just as he knew himself not to be a number
of things which Catherine would have wished him to be,
he was one thing in particular which she did not wish him
to be. There had been many times when, frankly, he had
congratulated himself on having been a human being long
before a multi-millionaire.</p>

<p>Through the space which he had vacated in the doorway
flocked a covey of fashion’s vultures. His audience formed
as he crossed the room and laid a golf-hardened grip upon
Seff’s shoulder. There was an instant of resistance. Then
he tore the man away from the cowering girl.</p>

<p>Almost was he tripped to a fall. Glancing down, he
noted a silken swirl upon the floor. His first act, after
throwing aside the drink-maddened roué, was to gather up
the negligee last shown outside and lay it about the model’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>He faced around to meet Seff’s thick-lipped threats.</p>

<p>“Wha&mdash;what do you mean? You’ll answer to me for
your interference and before you’re a minute older.”</p>

<p>The shopman chopped out at him recklessly, landing several
blows.</p>

<p>Taller than Seff by half a head, superbly fit in comparison,
John stood as if stricken by sudden inability. His
eyes were upon the scandalized throng that had crowded
into the room, rather than his opponent. He protected himself
in a confused, inadequate way from a succession of
attacks. The while he was considering a plan to spare the
girl odium and involve her tormentor.</p>

<p>Evidently elated by the success of his tactics, Seff paused
for emphasis.</p>

<p>“What d’you mean butting into my affairs?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“This,” answered John.</p>

<p>With the word, he sent his right fist to a particular spot
in the aesthetic’s neck.</p>

<p>The effect was startling. Seff’s head lopped, his eyes
rolled, his body wavered and stretched its length upon the
floor.</p>

<p>Fright-cries rose from the crush about the door; above
them, a shrill demand in Catherine’s voice.</p>

<p>“John, are you mad?”</p>

<p>The first person to reach the prone figure was, however,
without utterance. An equivocal look of dread and triumph
was on Mary Hutton’s face as she knelt beside the man
who was her employer and more; raised his head to her
knee; held a bottle of smelling salts to his nose.</p>

<p>John Cabot’s attention returned to the cause of the bout.</p>

<p>She had wrapped the negligee closely around her and
stood awaiting developments with dilated eyes&mdash;the model.
On her cheek the mark of teeth showed redder than before.
At his glance, she took a forward step, as if to thank him,
then, embarrassed by the press of people around the door,
stopped.</p>

<p>Without words, they two regarded only each other. Quite
still they stood, looking.</p>

<p>And as they looked, comrade spirits seemed to become
visible in the glow of an incipient understanding. Beside
her&mdash;faded in until to John it became as plain as her body&mdash;appeared
a vision of loveliness and lure. Shy, yet unafraid,
this vision beckoned him. From eyes bluer than the troubled
deeps of the girl’s gaze, it smiled on him. With hair
golden as the dreams of a child and tenuous as woman’s
wiles, it awoke in him a thrill like that on seeing the home-land
banner in foreign climes.</p>

<p>The while, in imagination, he heard the <i>Spring Song</i> of
Mendelssohn, vaguely passionate, played by the pure-yearning
notes of a flute. The fragrance that accompanies the
aspirations of youth filled his nostrils. A thought of apple-blossoms
hurt his mind with midsummer weariness.</p>

<p>From his heart, as if aroused by its increasing beat,
uprose response to the vision. Not as if born of the moment&mdash;rather
as if long protected from impious eyes&mdash;an
emotion new to him seemed to take form. He felt that
the girl, as well as he, must see and recognize.</p>

<p>Cruel with tenderness, eager with fear, the emotion that
had arisen from his heart-beats passed, like a gallant shape,
from him to her. In command that was, in truth, but a
prayer, it faced the comrade soul of her.</p>

<p>For a moment and an age, the eyes of the financier and
those of the shopgirl met and held, each pair the other.
Met also, in that age of moment’s length, the lad Amor,
a creature of the spirit whose first desire is to have and
to hold, with Innocentia, one not more to cherish than
to fear.</p>

<p>A low-voiced, fragmentary conversation recalled John to
the more material present.</p>

<p>“You, Mary?”</p>

<p>“Who else? At your worst I wouldn’t dare to desert
you.”</p>

<p>“Any more than I would you. If you hadn’t poured me
so much of&mdash;&mdash; Anyhow I’ve done what you said I
couldn’t do&mdash;put over a sweatshop fake that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush, Vin. Come, get up.”</p>

<p>Turning, John saw Mrs. Hutton steady Seff to his feet.</p>

<p>An imperative voice at his own elbow advised: “Better
come with me at once, John, unless you wish to get into
the newspapers.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I do wish, Catherine,” he said.</p>

<p>“But as the protector of this latest <i>Inconnue</i>?”</p>

<p>“Unknown?” John glanced at his wife surprisedly, then
on to the wall against which the manikin had stood.</p>

<p>Gone was the luring vision which his mother had taught
him to believe was the soul of womanhood. Gone also the
girl.</p>

<p>His sense of loss must have shown in his face.</p>

<p>“Why not play Don Quixote for some one more ambitious?”
Catherine gibed. “Ask me to nominate them&mdash;as
your wife I could choose the subjects with regard to the
family honor and glory. I tell you there are reporters in
that crowd. Once they recognize you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Reporters?” He took a step toward the crush. “Publicity&mdash;that’s
the cure for this scourge. Where are they?”</p>

<p>“But, John&mdash;&mdash;” The wife who never could decide
whether she disapproved or admired her husband the more,
remembered in the emergency to be guileful. “Would you
crush the victim to cure the scourge? Shouldn’t chivalry
protect the good name of that girl? At least, she is young.”</p>

<p>“And pure as a white violet. For once you are right.
Excuse me a moment. I must find a telephone.”</p>

<p>He strode away.</p>

<p>“Mule and mad, at that&mdash;a mad mule!”</p>

<p>The finality of Catherine’s thought-tribute returned her
to her own predicament. Her shrug redraped about her
shoulders the satin-smooth mantle of her social superiority.
There was a chance that she might escape inclusion in
whatever notoriety should ensue. Did not a woman and a
mother&mdash;the occasion evoked a thought of Jackie&mdash;owe her
first duty to herself? Let John take the consequences of his
mania for reform, even to being advertised as loitering alone
at the lingerie show!</p>

<p>Directly upon the decision to detach herself from possibly
unpleasant consequences, she skimmed the edge of the crowd
and left the store.</p>

<p>When John Cabot returned to the stage he saw that Seff
already was surrounded by the reporters. Mrs. Hutton
stood at his elbow, a bottle from which she evidently had
poured some sort of restorative in one hand, an emptied
glass in the other.</p>

<p>The shopman looked distressed, either by the dose pressed
upon him or by his recent experience&mdash;perhaps by both.
He was speaking with something of the fluency of his recent
“speech,” the while adjusting his delicately-toned tie and
brushing from one sleeve a reminder of his fall.</p>

<p>“I am Vincent Seff, owner of this establishment. A slight
misunderstanding occurred inside, yes. But I have a hope
that you good people, also guests at my entertainment,
will respect my hospitality enough to withhold its unfortunate
<i>finale</i> from your papers.”</p>

<p>The press representatives, three women and a lone man,
looked dubious at this hypothetical claim. A second man,
tilted in a chair against the wall, who was in the act of
finishing a creditable sketch of the manikin, lifted to Cabot
a companionable grin.</p>

<p>“Good, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. What will you take for it?”</p>

<p>“What will I take?” The grin broadened. “Why, a
better art job than the one I’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately I can’t pay that.”</p>

<p>“Sorry not to oblige an admirer of my work.” The artist
banged down the forelegs of the tilted chair and gathered
up his paraphernalia for departure. “If it’s your nice little
idea to keep the girl’s picture out of the paper, it wouldn’t
help any to withhold this. The camera gang departed on
the run some time ago.”</p>

<p>Seff, at Mrs. Hutton’s touch on his arm, had turned and
seen the addition to their group. He continued in urgent
tones:</p>

<p>“Of course you must write your stories right, boys and
girls. But I do wish you’d go light on this finish. For the
sake of a highly valued patron, I should regret to have a
certain name figured. Also, it scarcely seems fair to jeopard
the chances of an overly impulsive young girl, just at her
start of life.”</p>

<p>“But her scream, Mr. Seff?”</p>

<p>“And the door-smashing?”</p>

<p>“Not to mention that lively bout?”</p>

<p>The trio of women scribes prodded him, as though satellites
of the sport instead of fashion page.</p>

<p>The dapper designer plunged.</p>

<p>“I admit that there was a small fracas, but it was due
entirely to a misunderstanding. It is all patched up now,
therefore not worth mentioning. For once I was at fault
in my choice of an employee. You will agree, I am sure,
that my little attempt at an artistic display would not have
carried an evil suggestion to the clean minds for whose
pleasure and profit it was planned. I scarcely know how
to express myself, friends. Do try to appreciate my
position.”</p>

<p>He glanced, as if for helpful suggestion, toward Mary
Hutton, then went on, evidently planning his defense in
its delivery.</p>

<p>“The poor girl was hysterical from nervous strain over
her first public appearance. She could not have intended to
give such rein to her impulses as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash; Of course, a
woman who will exhibit herself in such a rôle is not
exactly&mdash;&mdash; Well, I’ll not go into that. But I owe it to
myself to say that even I, experienced at judging women
by their face values, would not have believed our guileless-looking
Dolores Trent capable of a deliberate attempt to
compromise an employer who&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Cad!</i>”</p>

<p>At the interruption, Seff took a backward step, evidently
remembering the reach and force of the speaker’s punch.</p>

<p>John Cabot, with a frown, stayed the three women and
lone man who, having been given the all-important name
of the woman in the case, were on the point of taking
wing.</p>

<p>“Best give a minute,” he advised. “You haven’t got the
real story yet. This sale is a fake. The goods were manufactured
in Seff’s own sweatshops right here in New York.
The money was taken under false pretenses. I am not in
position to state just how usual among supposedly high-class
shops is the sort of indelicacy we’ve witnessed this
morning. Fortunately, however, I am able to make an
example of this instance. I am John Cabot. I ask you to
investigate.”</p>

<p>“I have heard enough of this contemptible attack, no
matter who or what you are.” Seff hurled himself into
the breach as bravely as his condition would permit. “Nothing
but respect for the feelings of your wife has kept me
from having you ejected before this. You cannot influence
the newspapers against us. We are, as you should know,
persistent advertisers. I ask you now to go quietly and at
once, before I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed that his advice had been accepted.
John Cabot turned and crossed to the rim of the stage.
There he lifted his hand to the lingering society contingent.</p>

<p>“I have sent for the police,” he said. “They’ll be here
any minute now. They have a habit, I’m told, of taking
the names of eye-witnesses. Subpoenas generally arrive at
elsewhere-essential moments, so I’d suggest that such of you
as have any important engagements for the near future&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He had said enough. The remaining “valued patrons”
broke the leash of curiosity and hurried away after the
example of the “thoroughbred” Mrs. Cabot. Be it added
that they waited not for the elevator, nor counted the steps
in the flight of their descent.</p>

<p>For diverse reasons, a group remained with John Cabot
during his brief wait for the detectives of the nearby Tenderloin
police station. The reporters stayed because of
the “realer” crux of the story explaining the scream of
a shopgirl; Mrs. Hutton because, as she had asserted, she
dared not desert Seff; the owner himself because of the
competent look of a golf-steeled right, swinging from an
arm whose length and strength he knew.</p>

<p>The while, Seff gained considerable reassurance from a
<i>sotto voce</i> consultation with his forewoman who, in the
emergency, seemed to have reversed the usual relationship
of employed to employer. He greeted the officers as though
they had come at his request and asked that they search
the store for the model. She, although the cause of the disturbance,
would be needed, he declared, as his chief witness.</p>

<p>Upon the report that no trace of her could be found, he
addressed himself to the financier with a noticeable cessation
of resentment.</p>

<p>The girl was gone, he pointed. That fact was substantial
evidence of her guilty intent toward himself. No real harm
had been done and nothing would be gained by going through
with his arrest on a charge that could not be proved. Certainly,
with their combined influence, the unpleasant aftermath
of what so many had voted a pleasant morning could
be kept from the papers. Had Mr. Cabot no thought for
the consequence of the use of his name in such a connection?
Even though he cared nothing for his own reputation, did
he not owe something to his family? Sentiment aside,
with no complaining witness what could he gain to equal
what he should lose by carrying out his threat?</p>

<p>“But there is a complainant,” John assured him pleasantly
enough. “That rôle is mine.”</p>

<p>“<i>You?</i> Can you possibly intend&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hutton it was who found voice for direct demand.
“What is the charge? We have a right to know, sir.”</p>

<p>“Assault.” John Cabot directly faced the shopman.
Humor twitched his mouth as he asked: “Did you think
I let you hit me for my own selfish pleasure?”</p>

<p>As the motor patrol purred its way to the station house,
however, the amusement faded from his face. The Fall
air whipped his longing for the gentler zephyrs of Spring,
for the breath of apple-blooms, for the sound of a flute
playing Mendelssohn’s vaguely passionate theme.</p>

<p>He forced himself back to certain troubleful questions
of the moment. The manikin, Dolores Trent&mdash;what of her?
The very strength of his desire to find her advised that
he should not look for her. Why favor himself as a trailer,
while jailing Seff? But where would she hide herself&mdash;what
do?</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h3>
</div>

<p>Morning in a land of endless twilight!</p>

<p>The spirit-girl lay late abed after that first awakening
in Gehenna, as she realized with the switching off of the
mauve curtains which had shut sunrise from her chamber.
On her show of weariness after last night’s ordeal, she
had been told how King Satan, after his preference for
the customs of Earth, had time apportioned into periods
of day and night, with eventide and dawn, midnight and
noon exactly fixed. By means of his electric sun, moon
and attendant stars, supplied from the power accumulators
on the eastern and western fringes of the Gehennan desert,
the semi-light shed from the eternal radiance of the Elysian
Fields was made to seem negligible.</p>

<p>Dolores had been grateful for the respite. The shades
about the court, she had noted, looked more or less material
according to their naturalization into Shadow Land. She
herself had been declared unusually visible, even for a
new-comer, and was expected to have the habits of her
late estate. She had not slept the sleep of Earth, any
more than she had tasted the suggestion-foods of last
night’s banquet, except as a reminiscence of taste. And
yet, with eyelids closed against sight of what was, and
her inner vision limited to only the dearest of what had
been, she had passed into a sort of soul-rest&mdash;into memories
and imaginings that were one fond, commingled dream
of John Cabot.</p>

<p>Further aroused by a subservient voice, she sank an
elbow into the damask-sheened pillow; lifted herself; opened
eyes and mind to the now.</p>

<p>“Your shower is turned on, m’lady.”</p>

<p>The repetition was in English. Before, the same words
had been spoken in French. Such perfect intonation in
two languages piqued her interest. She glanced around
to see standing beside her couch a woman-shade in the
black and white of service.</p>

<p>“Madame’s hair is so black, perhaps she is Italian. I
trust I have not startled you. His Majesty ordered that
your bath be of cold cathode rays. They are very exhilarating
if one can stand the shock.”</p>

<p>Although this third offering came in the honey-sweet
language of love, a look of hate was on the serving woman’s
face.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” Dolores asked in the tongue of first
choice.</p>

<p>“You may call me Adeline. I am your maid.”</p>

<p>Somewhat disconcerted by the unservile gesture with
which a robe of rainbow lights was held out for her convenience,
Dolores put another question.</p>

<p>“How do you come to speak three languages? And
doesn’t the name Adeline mean of noble birth?”</p>

<p>“Ah, Madame also is French. She will the better understand.”
A smile less pleased than bitter stiffened the
patrician lips. “I am of noble birth and on earth was
treated according to my rank. But the judgment that consigned
me to the Realm of Reversals has changed all that.
Here we who were ladies serve our former maids. And
hard taskmistresses they are, given thus the power to equalize
their past humiliations.”</p>

<p>A thought of the fate awaiting Catherine Cabot made
Dolores shudder. “A grim conceit, that&mdash;I suppose the
King’s own?”</p>

<p>The demoted noblewoman nodded. “Not Lucretia Borgia
herself could have conceived so cruel a sentence. It is not
the tasks from which I suffer, but the thought of doing
them. My first position was to serve the creature whom
I had treated with all consideration in my household, she
who afterward cost me my husband, my position in society
and my life. Madame understands? I killed her. Madame’s
shower is turned on.”</p>

<p>She who never had been served sought to refuse the
offices of this quondam great lady. On Earth no one had
drawn up the morning shades for her, she declared; had
brushed the cobwebs of dreams from her lashes with dampened
cloths; had proffered the steaming beauty cup, perfumed
her bath, placed her mules, held her robe. No need
was there for Adeline to suffer while under assignment to
her.</p>

<p>She was ill-repaid for her kindly intent.</p>

<p>“It is, then, as I feared. Madame is but one of them
herself.”</p>

<p>With contemptuous manner, m’lady-who-was insisted
upon performing those duties which she knew so well from
having exacted them.</p>

<p>“I must serve you,” she explained, “whether you wish
to be served or not. I must work out my sentence. None
dares tamper with the Rule of the Realm of Reversals. My
husband warns me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your husband? Are you so fortunate as to have his
company here?”</p>

<p>A moment the maid contemplated the eagerness on her
new mistress’ face, then gave a vicious twist to the mass
of dark hair she was arranging. “That he received a red
ticket is the one bit of justice I have found in Greater
Gehenna. He bungled the trick of obtaining that verdict in
man’s favor usually granted gratis by the world.”</p>

<p>“You speak, Adeline, as though you hated him.”</p>

<p>“Hate him?” Fury shook the cultured voice. “Is it
not because of him that I am here? And he&mdash;always he
seeks me at the fête of servant-fiends to complain of the
humiliations forced upon him by his ex-valet, for well he
knows that his only chance of reversal will come through
me. Since Madame is so good as to inquire, I do hate the
man I loved. I hate him the more, perhaps, for controlling
his hate of me&mdash;for his pretense of continued love.”</p>

<p>To Dolores, the strange creature’s will to hurt her by
twisting her hair was kind compared with this unintentional
squeezing of the hope-drops from her heart. Would every
one about the court have power to make her suffer for her
past? When he whose companionship the lost soul of her
craved so unutterably should one day be sentenced to this
realm for their common social crime, would he also hide hate
in a pretense still to love?</p>

<p>But no. Although on Earth John had not sought her
as had other men and at the last had seemed to desert,
she dared not believe that the great heart of him could
change when he came through the gate into the Lower
Land&mdash;when, one day, he joined her.</p>

<p>The mother-soul’s good-morning to her babe was interrupted
by a message from the King. She was to attend
him at once in the Garden of Bad Luck.</p>

<p>Dismay possessed Dolores. Probably His Majesty meant
to probe deeper, with his knife-like cynicisms of last night,
into the wounds of her former state. But a thought of
the folly of foreboding soon steadied her. She had no
choice.</p>

<p>“I shall go at once,” she told the maid. “I feel quite
rested and strong.”</p>

<p>“I should suggest to Madame that she omit to mention
her restful night,” Adeline said. “Otherwise he will not
permit that it happen again. He awaits beside the Hard
Luck fountain.”</p>

<p>Dolores in turn offered advice. “While I am gone, doff
that cap and apron and imagine you are a lady again. He’ll
never know, for I won’t tell and the babe can’t.”</p>

<p>“Never know, <i>he</i>?” The French soul smiled briefly.
“Madame perhaps will excuse, but evidently she is not yet
acquainted with m’lord of reversals. <i>Know?</i> I myself
should tell him if none else did. He would compel me to
do so.”</p>

<p>To Dolores’ relief, the King seemed to have forgotten
her regrettable history when she found him awaiting her
at the spot of his appointment. At any rate, he made no
reference thereto.</p>

<p>“I am going to show you around my place,” he informed
her. “I take a pleasant shame in it. Guess I’ve got what
real-estaters call ‘the property sense’&mdash;a brand of nonsense.”</p>

<p>He led her through an avenue-like effect of lime trees
to a lawn of dwarfed red-top, where stood a winged vehicle,
as much an improvement over the planes of Earth as was
the motor-car over Grimes’ one-horse shay.</p>

<p>“My aeromobile,” he announced with prideful gesture.</p>

<p>Although of a mind given to taking for granted all
mechanical details, Dolores could not but wonder at this
craft. Its wings looked more like those of a huge hawk than
the rigid spread of the aeroplanes she had seen flying low
over Central Park. Instead of standing upon wheeled running-gear,
bird feet of a proportionate size clawed into the
ground. In its head glittered a constantly moving pair of
eyes.</p>

<p>“How ever do you rise in that?” Dolores asked. “And
once you do get up, how make it go? And up and off,
how do you land?”</p>

<p>He was frankly gratified by her interest.</p>

<p>“They call me,” he exulted, “‘Prince of the Power
of the Air.’ From its essence I create whatsoever I will.”</p>

<p>“Then this, too, is only illusion?”</p>

<p>“But illusion realer than the Rock of Ages. Effects made
by electricity are indestructible. You can switch them off,
as you can transfer existence from one state to another,
but you cannot destroy them.” His look intensified: “This
element and the immortal soul are the only two absolutely
steadfast quantities.”</p>

<p>“Except&mdash;” she hesitated&mdash;“except good in the heart.”</p>

<p>“Except evil in the mind, you mean.”</p>

<p>He snapped the correction at her, evidently displeased,
but soon returned to the subject of his “Hell Hawk.” In
a round of the machine, he showed her a propeller placed
beneath the fuselage by which it might be lifted straight
or lowered on reverse; explained the encased “pusher” at
the stern and “puller” at the bow which furnished silent,
horizontal speed; described the shock absorbers with which
the talons were equipped and the practicability of reflecting
scenes below in the moving, mirror-like eyes.</p>

<p>“Experience is the best demonstrator. May I hand you
in?”</p>

<p>Dolores sank into the double seat that swung like a hammock
across the roomy cock-pit. Satan placed himself beside
her, seized the “stick” by which his super-bird was directed
and pressed the starting button.</p>

<p>Like an elevator the aeromobile shot upward, with an
utter lack of vibration that gave the effect of hella-firma
receding, while their craft stood still. Soon, however, he
released the lofting button to press that which gave power
to the drivers. Forward through space they started at a
speed which would not have seemed speed at all, except
for the mounting figures finder-pointed upon a dial set into
the invisible air-screen before them. They seemed to hover
above, while Gehenna raced past them below.</p>

<p>“It is&mdash;is wonderful,” breathed the Apollyon guest,
pauperized in expression by the emotions that accompany
a first flight.</p>

<p>He nodded. “Consider this morning’s air-joying one of
your rewards for being, although a factory girl, <i>somewhat</i>
different from the rest.”</p>

<p>She turned to him. “You must have some object in
treating me so well. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Ha, you are like the rest, after all&mdash;curious!” His Highness
exclaimed. “Must every she-soul know the end of
the story first? Suppose my object is to acquaint you with
myself through my works. ‘By their works ye shall know
them.’ So look and know. Apply what mind you have to
getting a panoramic conception of the extent of my kingdom.
Notice the estates surrounding the palace park. I
have given them over to vari-villains so fortunate as to have
merited my approval.”</p>

<p>When Dolores gripped the edge of the swinging seat and
leaned to peer over the side of the fuselage, he objected.</p>

<p>“Why must you earthlings do everything the hardest way?
Let the Hawk see for you.”</p>

<p>He indicated an artfully arranged series of mirrors
which reflected through the eyes of the bird a moving picture
of scenes beneath.</p>

<p>“It looks like&mdash;like a picture postal-card of some tropical
city, only not so bright and more squat,” she observed after
a moment. “It is neatly laid out.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> neat,” Satan admitted. “Our perpetual heat-without-rain
does fade the colors, though. The only moisture
we get down here is when the angels weep over some new
triumph of mine. Hell knows I try to make them open the
ducts more often. If ever I learn to weep myself, I’ll likely
irrigate a lot of suffering.”</p>

<p>“And why do you wish to weep?”</p>

<p>“People seem to enjoy it so. As for the squatness of
the bungalows, what can you expect in the most tropical
of climates? Assume a little imagination if you have it not.
You should have seen the place before I took hold of it. At
first, after my sudden fall into utter desolation from the
Paradisian comforts of home, I couldn’t see any possibilities
in Gehenna. But I never was one to let bad enough alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t say I thought it bad,” Dolores hastened
to insert.</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t, but you’d better! Of course, it’s not
what it might be, even now, but it was a perfect chaos when
I began, a sort of peaceful haze, with not so much as a
suffering gnat for me to vent my disposition on.”</p>

<p>“It’s so different from anything that&mdash;&mdash;” Dolores puzzled.</p>

<p>“Did you expect to find Pluto wallowing in a lake of
fire, <i>á la</i> Milton?”</p>

<p>“Gehenna is a place of torture, isn’t it? I wasn’t taught
what they call religion in my childhood, but I typed the
sermons of a minister for a while and I know what&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She hesitated, regretting her persistence. Satan’s facial
expression, always mobile, had altered for the worse.</p>

<p>“A minister, eh?” he asked fiercely. “I suppose he ranted
the regular hell-fire stuff? Let me tell you that keeping
the realities of my place from the preach-praters of Earth
is the hardest thing I do. If they conceived a fraction of
my achievements in the torture line, even in this vestibule
to the real hell farther on, I’d never have a chance to hang
out the S. O. S. sign&mdash;never. Earthlings <i>would</i> be good
and The Great Intention foiled.”</p>

<p>“The Great Intention, sir? What can you mean?”</p>

<p>He glared at her; snarled his reply: “Greater than you
have gone to the chair of perpetual voltage for the impertinence
of asking that. None knows my Great Intention save
myself. It is ‘closed up and sealed until the time of the
end.’ But woe betide the red soul in Gehenna that does
not work toward its fulfillment!”</p>

<p>So threatening was his manner that the girl-shade shrank
away; as soon as she dared, returned her attention to the
topographical features of the world infernal.</p>

<p>Back whence they had come, over incalculable miles of
couchant dwellings, Apollyon Palace and its gardens glittered
in the rays of the artificial sun. On either side, taxing
to the eye as the illusive distances of a boundless desert,
detail merged into mirage-like suggestion of detail, until
nothing more could be imagined&mdash;quite nothing more except
infinitude of space.</p>

<p>As they sped through the high-tempered air, shafts of fire-flecked
smoke reached up as if to devour them. Directly
below, for sections which might have been miles or tens of
miles each, huddled a series of convex structures with the
round chimneys of pottery kilns. Massed here and there
were what looked to be warehouses and factories.</p>

<p>The tension of the royal mood relaxed in a free gesture.
“Object to my furnaces smoking? I have to burn some
fire and brimstone to satisfy the preconceived mortal idea
of damnation. The old-timers would think less of me if
I didn’t. At that, I’m sparing of it. Am bagging the
gases for future needs. You look surprised. Do earthlings
really believe that the idea of poison gas was made
in Germany? Why, my child, I’ve looked forward for
ages to the destructiveness of the fumes thrown off by
burning fiends incarnate&mdash;the real thing, you know, made
in Hell!”</p>

<p>Irritation again nettled his voice at the look on the face
bent low to gaze through the rising heat-hazes.</p>

<p>“You work as hard as a Cook’s tourist at sight-seeing.
Don’t make the mistake of supposing you can get more
than an illustrative idea of Greater Gehenna in a day, a
week or a year. Just a cursory glance this morning. To
the East stretch our fire-proof picture storage warehouses,
where we stow millions a minute of the life-films of important
earthlings. Below is the Devil’s Own Play-House.
Make a guess at its capacity.”</p>

<p>Dolores, however, made no guess. Her interest had centered
in a small, incredibly luminous lake that attracted even
as it hurt the eye.</p>

<p>“What is yonder pool and the great gleaming ball that
floats above, like the soap-bubble of a god?”</p>

<p>“That is the one biggest bubble of <i>the</i> god. Chief thing
I wanted you to see. You <i>have</i> a germ of intelligence&mdash;only
don’t bother to cultivate it, for it’s not to be compared
with your other attractions. What I want of you is&mdash;But
I digress.”</p>

<p>He declared the “bubble” his latest and greatest invention,
the last blow, so to speak, in motion picture photography, by
which events on Earth might be pictured simultaneously with
their occurrence.</p>

<p>Just then the Ball of Life, not being in use, was uncovered
that it might absorb atmospheric vitality. The countless
prisms of spirits of mercury which composed the pool
acted as one glass in reflecting distant Earth-scenes caught
by the whirling bubble, which ignored distances as it did
materialistic interference. The vast stadium when filled,
was enclosed with adjustable electric walls of dark green.
There, from under eye-shields, the doings of Earth might be
watched as they were done.</p>

<p>“If ever you get homesick, fair house-guest, I’ll give
you a look-in on the conduct of the dear detained.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you only&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dolores smothered her wish in the midst of its expression.</p>

<p>“If I only wouldn’t!” Rather disagreeably the King
laughed at her obviousness. “Now for a dip below the sun.
I abhor this pale, abiding light. Makes me blind as a bat.”</p>

<p>As they bolted downward, he volunteered to correct her
assumption that already she had arrived in Hell. Greater
Gehenna was only the starting station.</p>

<p>“We haven’t reached the bottomless pit or the lake of
fire yet, not by a world-full. And perhaps&mdash;&mdash;” His coherency
slackened. “Just <i>perhaps</i> we never shall. That
depends upon who is stronger when the test comes, the cast-out
near-angel or&mdash;&mdash; It is a strange thing if bad won’t
overcome good in the Universe&mdash;if ruthlessness and preparedness&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He checked himself, as though self-accused of disclosing
too much to such a neophyte. After a suspicious scowl
around at her, he continued:</p>

<p>“That hell-fire idea is only figurative. Why threaten the
spirit with physical duress? You have an expression on
Earth, ‘so near and yet so far,’ that has taught me the
refinement of torture. I want to show you close-ups of
some specials of my invention.”</p>

<p>Skimming low, he pointed her attention ahead to the Cage
of In-Law Relatives, “absolutely the most vicious spirits
ever caught in the toils of durance vile,” as he described
them, “and the only extant bipeds never tamed.”</p>

<p>What had looked a low mountain proved to be a dome-shaped
enclosure of such size that the curve on its either
side sloped gradually into the perspective. Through the
interstices of its barbed wall thousands upon thousands of
<i>manes</i>, more female than male, could be seen moving within.
From it blew a wind so malignant that Dolores’ eyes smarted
and her ears roared&mdash;a wind of whispers from countless
tongues all breathing forth hate at once. Not one of the
“in-laws” spoke out. All whispered.</p>

<p>“Blood egotists!” Satan chuckled. “As all the world is
more or less eligible for the Cage, I have space only for a
few of the most horrible examples. Seems an awful fate
to inflict them upon each other, but I discovered early that
they are a race unto themselves. There is nothing to equal
their viciousness, not even professional jealousy. After all,
it is the mean little emotions that people Hell.”</p>

<p>The lettered designation of a barrack-like structure Satan
read:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="allsmcap">BASTARD BABY WARD</span><br />
</p>

<p>“There lie the infant-shades along endless aisles. Their
cribs are lined with electro-cacti-spines. Their coverlets are
of satiny <i>bisnaga</i> petals sewed together with their own
needles.” His Highness fixed a side glance on the mother-soul’s
face as he enthused: “Although a virtuous bachelor,
I know that their whimpers mean they want milk. So I feed
that ‘so near and yet so far’ rule unto ‘even the least of
these.’ I have their nursing bottles filled with scalding,
opaque air.”</p>

<p>“But how can a baby deserve an evil fate?” Dolores
demanded. “I was not taught the Scriptures, but does the
Great-I-Am, as you call Him, countenance such a law?”</p>

<p>“My favorite author, Deuteronomy, answers that. ‘A
bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.
Even to his tenth generation shall he not enter in.’ The
sins of fathers being visited upon their children is an unjust
law that particularly appeals to me.”</p>

<p>At her sob he offered pseudo-consolation. “Be of good
cheer. Your bastard is not consigned to the Ward&mdash;that
is to say, not yet.”</p>

<p>Low over a subdivision more dusty than any passed they
sailed. Here the scraggliest effect of vegetation ceased.
Lizards moved languidly, if at all, and snakes lolled their
forked tongues.</p>

<p>Satan, apparently gratified by his proselyte’s nervousness,
apologized: “Sorry I cannot spare time this morning
to take you through Serpent’s Tooth Valley. I quite anticipate
your pleasure in the antics of my snakes&mdash;a sharp-tooth
pursuing every thankless well-begot. It’s a lively
place. You really should get in sympathy with the serpent.
He was my first agent and cannot be excelled for loathsomeness.
Can you see that rattler&mdash;that cobra? From
Arizona to the Indies they are feared, hated&mdash;<i>and</i> respected.
By an arbitrary edict, which I cannot at present veto, they’ve
been forced to crawl upon their bellies since early days. But
one of my first acts of reward to the unrighteous after I
have come into my own shall be to set them up again.
‘When snakes shall rise on their tails!’ A more inspiring line
never was writ.”</p>

<p>The tourist-by-command shuddered, but did not speak.
He followed her gaze toward a barren dune in the distance
over which a vapor hovered high as could be seen.</p>

<p>“Nits pestering the Traitors to Mothers, among whom I
threatened last night to throw my chef. Although they
are an assorted bad lot, we can afford to pass them, as I
had no mother and you next to none. Got the scheme of
the chuck-hole from the Book of Revelations: ‘Where
they shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.’
It is not that anything in particular is so unendurable. It’s
the way I keep it up. In rotation I visit all the old-fashioned
plagues upon them, murrain, boils and blains, frogs&mdash;But
imagine the rest. There is one special side-show that
will have a personal appeal to you to which I feel I should
take you before we return. Look out. I’m going to land.”</p>

<p>Again the Hawk had acted like an elevator. Its spreading
claws clutched the sanded soil, their shock absorbers
functioning without jar. The spirit-girl, once again upon
hella-firma, gazed dazedly about.</p>

<p>From the rim of a monstrous, crater-like cup nearby
spilled a steam like a giant’s breath, strong, noxious, horrific.
When Dolores shrank back, well-nigh overcome, her
Satanic guide fanned aside the fumes and drew her upward
toward the edge.</p>

<p>“Merely the regrets of the sirens,” he insisted. “This is
the one all-woman department of Gehenna, the Wanton’s
Well. Lean over. Look. See them gasp. See them try to
faint. They hope that they are dying, but no chance of
that. Not one ever thinks she deserves her fate or acknowledges
her own defiance of decency. Her own case, you
see, is always ‘different.’ Only when she is surrounded by
others of her kind, thousands of them worse than she, does
she begin to comprehend that in the judgments of men
woman’s unpardonable sin may have no difference. Think
of that, O fair and famed Dolores Trent&mdash;that between
you and these, your sisters, there is no difference!”</p>

<p>Although the girl-shade felt about to collapse, she was
held by his mental dominance. Leaning, she looked.</p>

<p>Her tormentor continued: “It is hot down there&mdash;hot as
the curse of society. The wantons burn in a fever of
lonely lust. They thirst for a sip of the affection and
poetry&mdash;even of the rashness which made the passion-cup
sweet. And all the endless hours until That Day they’ll not
get a drop to wet their lying lips and sin-blacked tongues.”</p>

<p>A tug upon the hem of the royal robe cut short the
inquisition. An aged female <i>manes</i>, sear-looking and fate-limned
as would have been a relief map of this Erubian
Realm, had tottered up behind them unheard. Her silvered
hair writhed backward in the blast from The Well. Her
hands shook toward it as shake withered grasses over a
dry creek bed.</p>

<p>“Sire, she cannot stand it much longer down there, my
Millie,” the crone-soul quavered.</p>

<p>“Ha, Grandma Nuisance again!” Unconventionally
Satan introduced her to Dolores. “An oldish lady who has
seen better days. Ever notice that most oldish ladies <i>have</i>
seen better days?”</p>

<p>“I am asking naught for myself, your gracious Majesty.
I was old enough to know better. But Millie wasn’t twenty
yet and that high-strung and sore-tempted.”</p>

<p>Ungraciously His Majesty continued to explain her:
“That dame, after an impeccable life on her own account,
plunged a knife through the licentious breast of an offspring
who, despite frequent asseverations that she’d rather be
dead, lacked courage to perform the function for herself.
They sentenced the old girl for life, the judge and jury
having that weakness for mothers which is bred in the
womb of the world. Down here, I haven’t seemed to find
the right berth for her, so have left her to her own devices,
which take the form of torturing herself in this existence
as in the last over the sins of her Millie the Magnificent.”</p>

<p>With threatening manner he turned on the crone.</p>

<p>“I told you not to follow me again.”</p>

<p>“But I am driven. I failed to fetch her up right or
she’d never have gone wrong. It’s all my fault. Let her
out of the well. Let me take her place.”</p>

<p>The grief coursing from her faded eyes seemed again
to change the variable royal mood. Seizing her wisp of
hair, he compelled her to the edge.</p>

<p>“At least you may suffer with her,” he conceded.
“Misery loves company, they say.” He thrust forward her
peaked face. When her eyes failed to moisture at thought
of the wrench he had given her neck, he essayed a wrench
at her heart.</p>

<p>“See Her Magnificence on the ledge just below, parching,
burning, dying an age-long death of thirst. Hi, there,
Millicent, have you thought out some new way you might
have married him? Here’s mother dear, come to bring
you a drink. How her brilliant beauty is fading under
drouth! You who suckled her as a babe, you cannot deny
her just one drop? But alas, your bosoms are withered as
your face. Surely, though, you’re not out of tears?” Over
the rim he called: “The drink, the <i>drink</i>, Millicent!
Mother’s tears&mdash;extra salt.”</p>

<p>Dolores understood that the struggles of the spirit-dame
and the wail that came from the depths were in resistance
of his mental brutality. Yet she, too, was moved to action
by a thought.</p>

<p>Stepping close to the edge, she contested Satan’s clutch
of the old shade; drew her back; bade her begone.</p>

<p>“Lift your prayers upward, mother,” she breathed in a
voice of the night-winds. “I have heard that only God
Himself can save.”</p>

<p>Her shoulders were seized in a fiendish clutch.</p>

<p>“Enough of that only-God drivel! You trying to checkmate
<i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>As she was twisted around to meet the Mind-Master’s
glare, she shook at the clash of his will against her own;
knew herself conquered; realized that, without being
dragged, she was returning to the rim of the Wantons’ Well.
She was going over ... over....</p>

<p>“Might as well end it now as later on,” Satan snarled.
“How are you going to like it down there, Dolores Trent&mdash;down
where your world has sent you&mdash;down where there
is no difference?”</p>

<p>All was over then, thought the spirit-girl. And her
baby&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She had heard his laughter quite a while before she began
to understand. Opening her eyes, she saw that she still
stood on hella-firma. In time she must have been willed
back from the brink. Nearby sat His Majesty, shaken by
unholy mirth.</p>

<p>To Dolores this ebullition was more terrifying than his
recent wrath. After the emotional stress of the morning,
she felt that she could not endure it. Glancing in the
direction taken by the crone-shade, she made out the bent
figure dissolving into the brume. She arose and faced her
tormentor.</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t laugh that way,” she said, calmly
as she could.</p>

<p>Satan wiped his eyes.</p>

<p>“I do get so amused at the rages into which I work myself
to frighten folks,” he commented when able to articulate.
“Really, you can’t imagine how much fun I have with
myself. Pardon me, but I&mdash;I just can’t get over your&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Won’t Your Highness oblige me by&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My Lowness.”</p>

<p>“Your Lowness. Please, Pluto.”</p>

<p>“‘Please, Pluto!’” Although mocking her, he settled
into seriousness. “When you get tricky like that&mdash;call me
friendly names for favors, you know&mdash;it is then that I have
hopes of you. Didn’t you know I was only fooling? Do
you suppose I’d drop you over the rim before hearing the
rest of those griefs to men?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They returned to the Hell Hawk by way of The Lane
of Futile Labors. Although the King seemed minded to
hurry, Dolores’ steps lagged, so absorbing were the illusory
sights on either hand.</p>

<p>In a fenced plot a gardener was on his knees before a
line of young rose-plants. A stray weed he pulled with
eager hand. The soil around the roots, pulverized already
from his diligence, he loosened yet again. Anxiously he
lifted his eyes toward the electric sun, the while fanning with
his trowel the drooping leaves.</p>

<p>“Soon the rain will fall. It must sometime,” he mumbled
to this plant and to that, as though addressing conscient
things. “If you’d bear me just one rose among you, even
a half-blown rose&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>So the old dodderer was back to roses again! Thus
Satan commented to the girl-shade. Roses were the gardener’s
specialty. He had begun with them a thousand years
before, trying between whiles to bring to bloom every
known flower, from shrubs to lowly blue-bells. Interesting
to keep count upon how often he would revert to the hopeless
hope of that one rose!</p>

<p>Over his bench an inventor twenty years dead was about
to try out a miniature airship over which he had spent the
entire span of his endless workdays. As the moment of the
test approached his hands twitched too spasmodically to
turn the propeller. Glancing up into the censorious smile
of the royal bystander, his face contorted by an expectancy
painful to see, he gained control. Next moment the invention
which he had quitted earth too soon to see perfected
lay on the ground. At his touch the model had quitted the
bench, hovered briefly in mid-air, then dropped.</p>

<p>An artist mixed paints on her palette. Over an impressionistic
study of the lurid sky-scape she worked, inspired
by sheer necessity. But the colors faded to a monotone, no
matter how thickly she laid them on.</p>

<p>Long before the end of the Lane, Dolores had begun to
understand. That one rose never would bloom. The model
plane could not fly. No paint squeezed from Avernian tubes
might express the genius of the artist-shade for even one
short hour. It was too late for the most ambitious spirit
to achieve.</p>

<p>Shadows from her somber thoughts were in the glance
uplifted to her guide.</p>

<p>“You have the askingest eyes,” observed he. “Very well.
I’ll give you a lift through the Lane of Labors. Of course
it is all illusion. The gardener imagines the weeds, the
inventor the crash of his plane, the artist her chromatic
pigments. And what we see in them is what they believe of
themselves. Just as well might they imagine success, except
for&mdash;For what now, do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“For fear?”</p>

<p>Satan nodded. “Thought you’d get the idea if I gave you
time. A singer fears that her voice will fail. It fails. A
woman with child fears for its inheritance. She bears a
defective. A sea captain fears that he cannot manage his
crew. From his weakness springs their mutiny. Except
for fear in the heart you earthlings could become a race
of gods.”</p>

<p>“Gehenna, then, is thwarted hope?”</p>

<p>“Gehenna is preconceived failure, built up on my revised
theory, where-there’s-hope-there’s-life! Diverts me how
they try and try, foredoomed by self-doubt. They don’t
and won’t know before That Day that they must fail. Absolutely
to know would be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hell?” Dolores’ lips shuddered the word.</p>

<p>“Hell will be despair. There none will try.”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and Heaven?”</p>

<p>With the query the girl-soul’s eyes were lighted by a
vague gleam&mdash;a suggestion that night is not so much the
end of a day past as the beginning of one to come.</p>

<p>“Heaven?” His Majesty scowled down at her. “Heaven,
it is supposed, will be progress&mdash;assured realization. Tell
me, did you ever find anything in realization?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet. But without faith&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A synonym for Heaven, that ‘not yet’!”&mdash;he said intolerantly.
“As for faith&mdash;bah! Faith is the fear of fools.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hurrying her toward the waiting Hawk, he broached:
“I am going to fly you back to Apollyon Palace over a
section which I think will enlarge your conception of my
place. Everything is at a standstill down here, <i>except</i>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The eager look which completed his sentence filled Dolores
with uneasiness greater than that aroused by the futile
labors of the Lane. Evidently he, master of these denizens
of doom, believed in some personal achievement. Did he
also hope in vain? Last night she had crucified her modesty
of soul in the hope of saving herself and her baby from
punishment. Would her effort fail? And John Cabot&mdash;oh,
surely the faith with which she clung to that hope of
one day seeing John again was not the fear of a fool!</p>

<p>The apprehension seen in all faces that morning now
looked from out her own. She felt much as when told the
nature of her employment in Vincent Seff’s shop that long-ago
day on Earth, after she had spent the sum advanced
her. What price was to be exacted of her in this new
position? What meant that studying regard of her&mdash;what
the varied encouragements which depressed her with sensations
more heavy, if less intelligible, than any of those proved
prescience in her former state?</p>

<p>Until <i>when</i>?</p>

<p>If <i>what</i>?</p>

<p><i>Except&mdash;&mdash;?</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Except me.”</p>

<p>Not until they were cleaving the air directly beneath the
high-swung sun did the King complete his suspended sentence.
Like mere specks behind and below them were the
cages and huts, the caves and wells and morasses of the
lower bad-lands. On either side discernible objects blended
into the sand sites reserved for expansion. Ahead, farther
than the mind could think, stretched yet more distances.
Truly a Cyclopean panorama, this topographical review of
the hope-hell of the lost!</p>

<p>Dolores could not regard merely the spectacle. Even as
she gazed forward and back, her heart ached over such
few individuals as she had seen and over the many she had
not seen. Some, mayhap, deserved their fate, although most,
she felt sure, were as was she, victims of the shallow judgments
of men. Would they, <i>could</i> they endure until the
Supreme Judge entered court? Could she?</p>

<p>At the burn of dry tears within her eyelids, she remembered
Satan’s exultation over the weeping angels. Even
should she weep, her tears, like the crone-soul’s, would be
salt&mdash;would tantalize, rather than refresh. She choked back
her emotion.</p>

<p>“A pretended interest in one’s escort is more gracious
than none at all.”</p>

<p>As from a distance, she heard Satan’s reproach. Recalling
her thoughts, she concentrated on what he was saying.</p>

<p>“How they hate me, yet how much more they fear me,
my fiends! Certainly I have the advantage over rulers of
Earth in needing no secret service protectorate. Unfortunately
for my subjects, I am immortal. They know that
they cannot kill the Master Mind, that mine is the only
spirit in Gehenna to which achievement is possible. That
fact I prove to them hourly through their sufferings. They
call me The Destroyer, yet am I their one great hope of
salvation.”</p>

<p>The boast puzzled Dolores. “The Destroyer a saviour?”</p>

<p>He showed surprise at her surprise.</p>

<p>“You don’t like me, my dear shade, or you’d show a more
credulous interest in my small confidences about myself.”</p>

<p>“I <i>am</i> interested, really.”</p>

<p>“Although you don’t like me? Never mind. I could
make you do so&mdash;could make you love me if I chose. But
I don’t wish to <i>make</i> you. Hell knows I’ve got my pride!”</p>

<p>He gave up to an attack of his lonely chortles. Evidently
he had “amused” himself again. Next moment he seized
the point of his Vandyke and straightened his countenance
to excessive length.</p>

<p>“Get behind me, ignoble impulse of pique! Mine other
cheek, turn thou for a blow!” Lowering his face to hers,
he added, most unexpectedly: “I don’t mind admitting
that you make it hard for me to be mean. Except that I
have a reputation for meanness which I must deserve&mdash;Anyhow,
it’s your turn to tell me something nice.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;why&mdash;” stammered Dolores. “I don’t understand&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you do. Something nice that you think about
me.”</p>

<p>Despite what she knew of him, the girl-shade was caught
by something of his own amusement at himself.</p>

<p>“I think,” she offered, “that at times you seem a very
good deal of a human being.”</p>

<p>Clamping the plane’s “joy stick” between his knees, His
Majesty threw up both hands toward the glory of his imitation
sky.</p>

<p>“As bad as that?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She could see, through his affected horror, that he was
complimented.</p>

<p>“For the smallest of favors, even though forced, I thank
you,” he said with an appearance of sincerity. “That, my
child, is what I’d like best to seem to be&mdash;just a long-lasting
man.”</p>

<p>“<i>My child!</i>” The unctuousness of his two words of
address, emphasized by his smug contemplation of her face,
made Dolores turn away with a new uneasy wonder.
Some one on Earth had called her “my child” with that same
accent and gaze. <i>Who?</i></p>

<p>Her distraction irritated him.</p>

<p>“Don’t sit there looking like a magazine cover. Your
profile is odiously seraphic. If I’d seen it first, I’d not have
given you a second thought.... That’s better....
When I compare that asking look in your eyes with the
dear little wrinkles around your mouth&mdash;those <i>dear</i> little
wrinkles&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>So long and so strangely did he continue to contemplate
her that Dolores risked his displeasure by covering her face
with her hands. Again he surprised her.</p>

<p>“Your methods are unlike those of any in the whole Well
of Wantons. At times it is hard to believe the worst of
you. Looking straight into your eyes, one sees&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His pause she interrupted with an almost beseeching
reminder.</p>

<p>“Does one&mdash;what?”</p>

<p>“Well, what has been your experience? Doesn’t one?”</p>

<p>His laugh was an insult.</p>

<p>Denied the eyes in whose royal purple shadows lurked
“that look” which, underscored by the lines about her
smileless mouth, had got on his imagination, he soon tired
of the joke at her expense.</p>

<p>“You are a helliot for looks, no doubt of that,” he remarked
crisply. “What I want to know is&mdash;can you <i>fight</i>?”</p>

<p>“Fight, Your&mdash;Your Lowness? Why should I fight?”</p>

<p>He did not answer either himself or her. His manner
changed. He appeared chiefly impatient.</p>

<p>“You’d think I could manufacture time, the way I’m
wasting it. With the crimes of the mortal world awaiting
my direction, I itinerate you through this tour. Not that
I think the education will be wasted on you. My original
conviction that it won’t be is strengthened. But I must get
back.”</p>

<p>“I am ready to return at once, sir.”</p>

<p>“You look more than ready. This is a case, however,
where the longest way round may prove the shortest home.”</p>

<p>He put The Hawk to its highest speed. It seemed that
they might beat the winds in any race, beat thought, beat
even light. With the edges of cleft air, Satan’s instructions
cut into Dolores’ consciousness.</p>

<p>“The scenes we’re about to skirt will demonstrate why
I’ve striven through the ages for numbers. Look you
toward the east.”</p>

<p>Urged by a certain hard-suppressed excitement in his
voice, Dolores strained her sight in the direction of his
gesture. Approaching them from the doubtful distances,
came a vast company of uniformed shades. On either side
stretched countless tents.</p>

<p>“Can it be that you keep up&mdash;” she hesitated over the
improbable thought&mdash;“an army?”</p>

<p>“The Hordes of Hades.” The splendid head threw back
until its red beard stabbed the forward air. The steel-cold
voice slashed like a sword. “Focus what imagination you
have on their probable numbers&mdash;unheard-of billions strong.
Try to conceive the ruthlessness possible to demons freed
from the fear of death. Consider the impossibility of the
most arrant coward’s desertion with my brand stamped on
his brow.”</p>

<p>In her effort to obey, expression failed the spirit-girl.</p>

<p>Glancing around at her, Satan frowned. “Nothing to
say, as usual? You’ve not yet suspected, then, that the basic
principle of Gehenna is militaristic? Where would any
autocrat be without defense for his autocracy?”</p>

<p>“This army, of what race is it come?”</p>

<p>At the simplicity of her question, His Highness laughed.
“Do you think for a moment that a one-race army would
be enough for me? I may have been wrong since birth,
but I’m right in the safety of numbers. The hosts below
are conscripted from the best bad men since Cain&mdash;Europeans
and Americans from Japheth; Arabs, Jews, <i>et al.</i>,
from Shem; Egyptians and Africans from Ham. Not
chosen by God, but by me, and on the principle that in the
heart of every man, be he white or black, red or yellow, is
the incipient germ of fratricide. Might is right&mdash;a slogan
of my coinage. Hell over all, say I!”</p>

<p>With face working and eyes blinded by their own flare,
he applied shaking fingers to the speed buttons of the
aeromobile.</p>

<p>“Truth is <i>stronger</i> than fiction,” he declared. “Down
there you see a suggestion of the truth about me. But I
need more man-made demons to demonstrate that truth. I
must have more, more, and yet more.”</p>

<p>His intensity affected Dolores like the winds which had
chilled her to the soul on her recent trudge through the
Valley of Death.</p>

<p>“I depend upon the beast that is in every man, as shown
by the way the most fanatic pacifist will fight when forced
over the top. But how to gain recruits in bulk, now that
the World War has failed!”</p>

<p>As they soared directly over the first encampment, he
leaned to the mirror that reflected The Hawk’s revolving
eyes and began to count in numerals strange to his guest
the units in that section. Her brain, so recently finite, grew
dizzy in the attempt to follow him.</p>

<p>Evidently he felt gratified by his computations. “Already
a creditable army. Nobody but the Great-I-Am knows the
trouble I’ve had recruiting them and He only because He
has been kept so busy trying to block me. From the first,
I’ve counted on wearing Him out&mdash;getting Him so tired
that He’ll be willing to let Nature take its course. Looked
recently as though I’d succeeded, but I am beginning to
fear&mdash;what with peace blanketing all the bad old predatory
instincts and temperance creeping like a tidal wave over
the mortal world&mdash;My time is getting short. I must
think&mdash;must concentrate.”</p>

<p>As he relapsed into what seemed urgent introspection,
a ruddy mist began to emanate, first from his head, then
his body. Open as was the air-scape and swift their flight,
a noxious odor spread.</p>

<p>For a space they alternated tail-spins and nose-dives with
loops in the lurid altitudes. Dolores, from her earth-habit
of fear, cried out against such recklessness.</p>

<p>His Majesty’s dazed look suggested that her protest had
recalled him from some evil spell. The emanations from
his body thinned and ceased.</p>

<p>“Too much joy in our ride, my child? You’d forgive my
abstraction if you realized how I am ulcering from the
trick the teetotalers put over on me&mdash;and only because I
felt too strong to fear their weakness.”</p>

<p>A scorching glance he threw across at her, as though
she had spoken objection. “You’ve got to take what you get
when you’re dead, you know. <i>I</i> am what most of you get.
All I need to force the rookies of yonder army to my will
is their own consciences. The morale is the only thing. They
know what they deserve and I am their only chance of
escaping it. It means something to those Relicts of Right
for me to remark, ‘To hell with you!’”</p>

<p>The girl-shade’s eyes stung, not so much from the rush
of torrid air as the effort to face his blighting gaze. Her
conceptions were overtaxed, her mind fagged, her heart
hurting with anxiety for the earthlings over whom she still
yearned. Realizing that some response was expected of
her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“But why do you train so many millions of the lost?”</p>

<p>“Lost? Under my training they find themselves, just as
you soon shall be finding yourself and your powers for
evil.” He eyed her yet more tryingly. “Why do you suppose,
now?”</p>

<p>“Is it&mdash;” Dolores shuddered&mdash;“to send their spirits
in force to the living world, to conquer all that are left?
At the Mystery Gate I was told that none might return
who had crossed into Shadow Land.”</p>

<p>“You were told aright. The conflict for which my troops
are training will be in the Inter-World&mdash;an irresistible onslaught
of fiendishness. Do you suppose that I’ve been
straining my inventiveness all these centuries to arouse the
beast in every man simply for amusement? I have not yet
begun to show my power. But it won’t be long now to
wait.”</p>

<p>“And then?” Shaken by dread greater than her comprehension,
she shrank away from him. “Do you speak of
your Great Intention?”</p>

<p>His look leaped after her, a devouring fire.</p>

<p>“I speak of a night far spent&mdash;of a day that is at hand.
I speak of earth and water and air that shall cleave together
as component parts of chaos, of heavens that shall stretch
out ‘like a curtain,’ of hordes that shall put on the ‘armor
of light.’ No time to call on the gods of men in my surprise.
No pause for a thought of reprieve. If love generates
electricity, what of hate? Hate shall be the ammunition
of the great drive. A fanfare of poisoned thoughts shall
open the fire. Once the lapsing fear for mortality is
burned to dross, my demands shall be granted. You dare
to probe the mystery of my Intention? Keep those asking
eyes of yours on me, Dolores Trent. <i>I</i> am the mystery
of Mystery Land!”</p>

<p>Loud he hurled this declaration into the heated air. As
though spoken into some megaphone of surpassing conductive
power, it reverberated away and away, down and down.
At its message, lightning licked the air, to be gulped in turn
by thunder. From below echoed tumult so great that the
atmospheric response rumbled as from volcanic eruptions.
Shrieks arose from the Hadean hordes.</p>

<p>His Majesty, slowing and steadying their craft as a
bird holds poise, pulled the girl-soul to her feet and with
her leaned to watch, first-sight, the troops rushing into
formation. Soon sight of the units was cut off by slashing
swords of light. A fetid gas arose from the on-rush.</p>

<p>In an ague of undefined terror, Dolores felt herself further
shaken by the clutch on her arm; heard the Prince
of the Power of the Air again give himself over to mirth.</p>

<p>“Fool fiends, they hear my voice and think it is That
Day! Not bad for an impromptu practice drive, eh? Once
all fear is drilled out of them, once their numbers are complete,
once the full force of that gas is turned on&mdash;Ah, nothing
and none may stand against the hate of Hell!”</p>

<p>Skimming the upper air toward the palace, he centered
his attention on the cowering convert to his power.</p>

<p>“Whether you rise to the rôle in this new comedy divine
for which I am considering you, depends upon yourself,” he
told her. “Your first séance was one of fair success. But
nerve yourself for to-night lest you fail to entertain. After
what you have seen to-day, you’d not wish to fail?”</p>

<p>The weight of her responsibility crushed out her reply.</p>

<p>“I should not dare to fail.”</p>

<p>He nodded, his hope evidently strengthened, as hers had
been weakened, by the morning’s flight.</p>

<p>“That Day you ask about&mdash;I do not understand myself
why it has been postponed so long. Do you suppose&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>As if startled by his own thought, Satan caught her hand
with a touch that pained like a burn, yet left no mark. His
voice sagged superstitiously as he finished:</p>

<p>“Do you suppose it could have been ordained that I
should wait&mdash;for <i>you</i>?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h3>
</div>

<p>“When hall bedrooms are alcoves in disguise”&mdash;so said
the Royal Entertainer&mdash;“their inner walls are likely to be
thin.”</p>

<p>This was true of the haven paid for in advance by Dolores
Trent&mdash;true as thin. Often during that first night after the
dénouement at Seff’s she had need to remind herself of
the fact and of the sleep needs of the actor lady in the
adjoining star-guest chamber. It was hard, though, not to
cry, when she kept thinking of her father lying underneath
his sod blanket out in the rain. Indeed, she did not sleep
until after the rain had stopped.</p>

<p>Comfort came with oblivion. In her dreams somebody
strong, young and ardent entered her door as though he
had the right&mdash;the love-lad who, in a vision more real than
the shameful reality of the store-stage scene, had crossed
to her side from the stranger who had rescued her. Through
the narrow space between the wall and her cot he slipped;
sat looking at her from the single, stiff chair; at last leaned
down and, ever so tenderly, kissed her on the lips.</p>

<p>A peremptory knock awakened her. In the coarse night-gown,
which had felt like the embrace of a mother after
those cobwebby things at Seff’s, she opened the door a
crack upon the young blond hair and old brunette face of
her landlady.</p>

<p>“Your week being up to-day, there’ll be no refund. Your
trunk not yet having come, it won’t take you long to pack
and go.”</p>

<p>“Go? Go where?” Dolores asked.</p>

<p>The reply, although characteristically and participially
indirect, was clear. “Being raised decent myself and with
God’s help running a decent house, it’s not for me to say
more than that out you’re going, bag and baggage.”</p>

<p>Had some one from the lingerie shop acquainted the lady
of the house with the news of the fiasco of yesterday&mdash;perhaps
Vincent Seff himself? Did he mean to discredit her
further&mdash;to hound her with advances or reproach?</p>

<p>The possibility determined her against any attempt at
explanation or appeal. Beyond this decision she had not
time to think until she found herself seated in a one-arm
chair of a self-service restaurant. Beside her stood the
alligator bag. In her palm lay the residue of her recent
wealth, two quarters; a substantial surplus, however, as
compared with the solitary nickel expended for the nectarine
that had decided her engagement only one week
before.</p>

<p>Coffee and crullers&mdash;a delicious breakfast when sweetened
with the thought that she was released from her hideous
bondage, the thought that she was free! With the weak
brew came strong thoughts.</p>

<p>Why had she discounted her heritage of education? Why
consider work in factories or shops when she spoke three
languages and read in five? Surely Trevor Trent, acknowledged
a brilliant translator by his severest critics, had not
shunted his latter-day work upon her shoulders for naught!
She would look higher for employment; would climb to a
place where morals were disciplined by minds.</p>

<p>She was sipping from the thick cup the last thin drop.
A chunky man, in rising from the next chair, dropped his
newspaper on the floor. Of such figure that he might not
recover it without inconvenience, he stepped upon and
over it. Dolores picked it up and called to him. But either
he was through with it, or did not wish to concede his lack
of equipoise. Despite the waddle with which he went out
the door, Dolores regarded him as a god&mdash;the paper his gift.
She began to turn its pages in search of the “Help Wanted”
columns.</p>

<p>As chanced, she did not read the close-print pleas. A
picture on the last page distracted her&mdash;a bold, drawn-from-life
sketch of herself which was its own indictment of the
flimsy garb in which she was portrayed.</p>

<p>Dolores’ pleasure in the crullers receded into the distant
past. Gone were the strong thoughts sipped from the weak
brew. Of what use to look higher when placarded as so
low? Any one might recognize her now. With her paper
napkin she brushed away the mist that had gathered before
her eyes and bent to the type which surrounded the cut.</p>

<p>Dolores Trent, subject of the sketch, was recommended
to the reader’s interest as the principal in a lingerie shop
scandal reported in detail in another column. That the incident
was to be made the cause of a reform in the use of
human merchandise was promised in a spirited interview
with John Cabot, noted financier, who had preferred a
charge of assault against Vincent Seff, the offending shopkeeper.</p>

<p>In the column referred to, the girl found a detailed
report of the impromptu scene which had followed the
playlet of “The Little Old Lady of Lorraine,” a paragraph
of speculation upon her own disappearance and another
which declared that the beautiful Mrs. John Cabot was
confined to her home in a state of nervous collapse because
of the notoriety brought on the family by her husband’s
behavior.</p>

<p>Dolores crumpled the newspaper and threw it into the
self-service trash basket. She had better cause to relinquish
it than the over-fat god!</p>

<p>Out upon the street, she foresaw other relinquishments.
Small use was there for her to seek employment until
to-day’s news had passed into the discard of several yesterdays.
Doubtless this story, rather than direct word from
the Seff shop, had brought about the morning’s summary
eviction. Well might she expect to remain roomless until a
lapse of time had lessened chances of comparison between
her face and the sketch. More harm than help had been
worked by the volunteer protectorate of Mr. John Cabot,
who unfortunately was of social importance or he would not
have been given such space in the news. And that imagined
kiss which had soothed her slumbers in the pristine dawn&mdash;why
its false assurance of security?</p>

<p>Was it fancy or fact that people were staring at her?
Probably she did look strange. Well-dressed young girls
did not saunter, traveling bags in hand. Not noting in
what direction, she hastened her steps. She must appear
to be bound somewhere, as if to meet someone.</p>

<p>In truth, she was. She felt her arm seized in a strong
grip; heard a voice in brogue reproving her.</p>

<p>“Battlin’ bantham, woman, where’d you get it so early
in the mornin’&mdash;or was it, now, so late last night?”</p>

<p>In cross-cutting a juncture of car-tracks already congested,
Dolores had tripped and been forcefully thrown into
the arms of a policeman. As he escorted her toward the
curb, she assured him that his first conclusion about her
was wrong. She had been trying to think and hurry at the
same time, that was all.</p>

<p>He was a fine specimen of the city’s choice, young, well
set-up, weather-bronzed. He begged her pardon for his
mistake. When he turned to leave her Dolores had a
sudden sense of loss.</p>

<p>“If you please&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She caught his arm and gazed up at him, her lips uncertain
over what next to say.</p>

<p>He showed surprise at her touch and look, but leaned to
her. And as he leaned, red color waved across his tan.</p>

<p>“Faith,” he said, “I’d hate to meet you goin’ home at
night!”</p>

<p>At once Dolores regretted her impulse. Unless she
wished to be further mistaken, however, she must continue.</p>

<p>“If you were a girl and needed work,” she asked, “how
should you go about getting it?”</p>

<p>More slowly than it had come, the color receded from
the young policeman’s face. With a deliberate movement,
he lifted her hand off his arm.</p>

<p>“Miss, my baby’s not a year yet and her eyes are blue,
but they’ve got something the look of your own.” He added
the advice she had asked. “If I was a girl and a girl like
you, sure I’d lock myself in my satchel until I got off Broadway.
The satchel I’d check in some regular employment
agency and there I’d stay until I got me job. There’s one
in the next block, kept by an Irisher friend of mine who
ain’t half as bad, believe me, as her near-French accent. Ask
for Madame Marie Sheehan, née Mrs. Mary Shinn, and
tell her Donovan O’Shay recommended you to her. Here,
I’ll write it down.”</p>

<p>Upon a police pad whipped from beneath his uniform,
he scribbled hurriedly; tore off the sheet; pressed it into
her hand. With a kindly, “best o’ luck to you, miss,” he
dived back into the traffic tide.</p>

<p>Dolores watched him disappear in the rush of it with
admiration for more than his physique. She appreciated
him more than she might have done two weeks ago. A
thrill of pride tingled through her that the city, her wonderful
New York, could choose so well.</p>

<p>Too bad, when she felt such confidence in him, that his
name and the penciled slip were not the practical present aid
he thought! To apply at a “regular” employment agency
she would need a better reference than the too graphic one
pressed upon her by the morning paper. The slip she placed
carefully in her purse. “Née Mary Shinn” she would regard
as to-morrow’s possibility, rather than the risk of to-day.</p>

<p>But she could and did follow other of his advices. She
turned off the broad white way, proved to be so narrow
and so dark; walked briskly eastward.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the warning of the young Celt, whose
girl-baby’s eyes had “something the look” of her own, that
awoke in Dolores the desire to get back among the sort of
people with whom she had lived. Soon she left the
cross street and turned north along one of the small-numbered
avenues.</p>

<p>Somehow she had ceased to feel the strangeness of her
position; scarcely seemed thinking at all, except for a vague
worry over why she was not worrying. A quite unreasonable
sense that she would happen upon some recognizable
sign-post to her immediate future possessed her. She became
cheerful, as though some one she trusted had made
her a promise of help.</p>

<p>Over the door of a substantial building of corner-lot dignity,
she stopped to read this placard:</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">
RESCUE HOME<br />
CHURCH OF ALL MANKIND
</p>

<p>Of neither church nor home had she ever heard, but
surely she needed rescue as urgently as could any of mankind.
She climbed the stone steps; rang the bell.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a negro boy. At her hesitant
question he ushered her into a business-like office. A plain-faced
girl, who looked to be about Dolores’ own age, sat
behind a typewriter, busy with a stick of chewing gum
and a newspaper. Through an inner door appeared a
woman who introduced herself as the matron of the home.</p>

<p>Dolores ended her story with the death of her father and
her consequent need of a place to stay until she could find
employment. She did not notice that the stenographer had
left them until that industriously-chewing young person
beckoned to the matron from the private office.</p>

<p>“Just wait a few minutes,” said the older woman as
she rose. “I have an idea we can help you.”</p>

<p>Only the buzz of their low-voiced conversation carried
through the half-closed door. When the matron returned
she carried in her hand a copy of the same newspaper over
which the too-fat god of the restaurant had not dared risk
his dignity. She peered over her glasses at the applicant,
then through them at the last-page illustration.</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> quick at faces, Gracie,” she said to her aide.
To Dolores: “I am sorry, Miss&mdash;ah&mdash;Trent, but I doubt
your sincerity in asking our sort of help. Already you have
violated our first rule&mdash;absolute frankness. This journal
explains better than you have done why you need cover in
a respectable place. I’m afraid you would not feel at home
here.”</p>

<p>“Not in them clothes,” contributed Gracie.</p>

<p>“My <i>dear</i>!” Then again to Dolores: “We do not wish
to seem unresponsive to the needs of any unfortunate, but
there is a great deal behind my decision. Good morning,
Miss Trent.”</p>

<p>“Good morning.”</p>

<p>Dolores accepted the matron’s decision quietly, as she
had the previous rebuffs of her life, and started toward the
door.</p>

<p>“Are you leaving, my child?”</p>

<p>The voice was strong yet mellifluous. Dolores saw surveying
them from the dark background of the hall a man
in clerical clothes. He looked to be middle-aged; was of
medium height, medium weight, medium coloring. From
him, however, flowed an extraordinary personality. No
smile showed beneath his brown mustache or in his agate-colored
eyes, yet he beamed with beneficence.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dr. Willard,” the matron answered. “The young
lady deliberately deceived me as to her identity. Possibly
you have not run through the morning papers. This picture
will tell you more quickly than I can explain why I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dolores’ impulse was to continue into the hall, but she
as well as the matron stopped at the clergyman’s gesture.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen this one, no,” he admitted, studying the
sketch interestedly, then the girl herself. “There are photographs
of her, however, in three of the other papers. She is
sketchable&mdash;very sketchable.”</p>

<p>“Knowing how the home has been imposed upon in the
past, you will, I am sure, approve my decision,” the matron
continued in her calm, competent way. “With so many in
it whom we hope to influence to high standards, fair-play
forbids that we allow it to be made a free hotel for the convenience
of a class who make sport of its object. One bad
example spoils a dozen good. I feel very strongly on this
subject, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. You always feel strongly.”</p>

<p>No sarcasm showed in his voice or look. His rebuke was
the more telling because so quietly put.</p>

<p>“I shall not interfere with your decision in this case so
far as concerns the Home. But as pastor of the Church of
All Mankind, I do not feel that I should permit generalities
to affect my personal interest in cases. Surely ‘all mankind’
includes girlhood, the future of the Nation. Come
with me, young lady. I’ll see what we can do for you.”</p>

<p>All within five minutes, Dolores found herself ushered
into the private office of the autocrat of the institution whose
doors had been closing upon her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That there was a crack in her cup of content had come to
be a belief of Dolores Trent. From her earliest remembrance
there always had seemed to be more or less of
seepage. Nevertheless, as protégé of Dr. Alexander Willard&mdash;his
pet charity, he called her&mdash;she felt that the waste should
cease.</p>

<p>The Church of All Mankind was a granite pile which
did proud the outward religious show of its parishioners.
From a height it returned serenely the troubled gaze of the
Hudson. Its lawns suggested that each blade of grass was
especially endowed. Behind the auditorium, with its wide-welcome
doors, arched memorial windows and statued niches
for the more generous benefactors, had been erected a two-story,
utilitarian annex. Of the same stone and general
architectural lines as the church proper, this contained,
in addition to lecture, board and office rooms, the pastor’s
study.</p>

<p>Here Dolores had been installed on the day of her
“rescue” from the East Side home which ranked first among
the charities of All Mankind. Here she soon had learned
to manipulate a typewriter with sufficient speed to take letters
from dictation and prepare large-type pulpit copies of the
sensational sermons for which Dr. Willard was widely
known. Here, in brief, she had mastered the preliminaries
of a secretaryship.</p>

<p>Despite frequent praise of her aptitude, her grasp of
English and a natural facility in the creation of oratorical
effects, she somehow could not cease to regard her employment
as providential and the reverend doctor as her personal
Providence. “The lower they sink, the higher we lift them”&mdash;that
had been his comment on refusing to hear her attempted
explanation of the shop scandal. Neither would he
recognize any connection between his initiative in her behalf
and the fact that the John Cabots were hereditary members
of his congregation.</p>

<p>The rescue matron’s bigotry he had deplored as “a pinch”
in a nature usually broad. To err was human, he reported
himself as having told her, but she must not be human
in the same way again. To his wider vision, the Home had
been established for just such as Dolores Trent. He had
the girl to thank, not she him, for the chance to prove his
philanthropy.</p>

<p>Provided with the very sort of work for which she was
best fitted and housed comfortably in the apartment of one
of those humbler parishioners always attached to rich
churches, she realized one mid-morning, less than a month
after the Seff debacle, that she still was in a state of discontent.
Alone in the study, she paused in her copying
to take herself to task.</p>

<p>Why be so unappreciative as not to be happy? Her immediate
predecessor, for whom she had felt inclined to be sorry,
had lost the position because, as Dr. Willard explained, she
wasn’t appreciative.</p>

<p>The only manifest reason for her state of mind lay in
the stuffed animals and birds, slain by the distinguished
clergyman on his hunting trips, with which the room was
given individuality. Over the fireplace was hung a magnificently
antlered moose head. A glass-eyed doe, a pair
of stuffed foxes and lesser game stood about in natural
attitudes. From the ceiling various birds strove on wires,
as though in flight. Particularly lifelike was a fine specimen
of lynx, posed ready to spring just within the
door.</p>

<p>Although the new secretary had heard many compliments
paid this trophy collection and had read her employer referred
to as “Dr. Nimrod” and “The Hunting Parson,” she
could not admire in him this passion for the chase. The
very naturalness of the poor, pretty creatures made her
deplore their cut-short lives.</p>

<p>Often she found herself imagining the one-time fleetness
of the doe or the swish of the wind-spread wings of the
golden eagle, wired in an attitude of flying, pitiable because
never&mdash;never would he fly again. A teasing explanation of
the lynx’s crouch made by the doctor to a woman parishioner
sounded tame beside the ferocity which the taxidermist had
stuffed into the specimen.</p>

<p>“I keep the big cat by the door to startle my visiting
ladies. He gives them a sensation, hurries their blood, makes
them natural.”</p>

<p>Slavery to such a mission did seem hard on the lynx
after the free life he must have led to achieve his immense
size. Dolores, yielding to her fanciful mood, crossed the
room and offered him a bite from her paper-bag lunch.
Crouched beside him, her arm around his neck&mdash;So the
minister found her when he brisked in for a belated inspection
of the morning mail.</p>

<p>He gave her an indulgent smile as she sprang to her feet,
but contributed no remark to her embarrassment.</p>

<p>She had finished taking the daily grist of replies. Dr.
Willard was sitting in his chair, his feet on the hassock that
stood always before it, looking at her in a way he had to
which she could not grow accustomed. Probably he was
not thinking of her at all&mdash;was mentally selecting the task
of next importance. Yet she had grown more than usually
restive under his agate-eyed, considering gaze when the
beautifully covered top-tones of a soprano voice floated to
them from the floor above.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Lead thou me on....</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Ah!” Dr. Willard repeated his smile. “The members
of the music committee are having their innings.”</p>

<p>“Their innings, doctor?”</p>

<p>“They are holding try-outs for a new soprano. I expect
they’ll have difficulty finding one to suit. You like
that floating quality? It is sort of seraphic. But, dear
me, there are so many requirements other than the voice to
fill this position, which is probably <i>the</i> highest-paid for a
church soloist in Greater New York. The committee has
heard this young woman several times and all agree with me
except Deacon Brill. He’s the only thorn in my flesh on the
board.”</p>

<p>“He does seem to feel a natural antipathy toward you,”
Dolores sympathized.</p>

<p>“Very natural.” Again that peculiarly indulgent smile.
“As he is the central pillar of the church, I try not to collide
with him. You see, he has taken this singer&mdash;a good-looking
girl in addition to her vocal charms&mdash;out to dinner. He
says she won’t do.”</p>

<p>“Won’t do&mdash;and because he took her out to dinner?”</p>

<p>Before Dr. Willard could explain, his private telephone
rang.</p>

<p>“You at last, my child!” he answered close to the mouthpiece.
“So, he’s broken out again? I am disappointed....
These attacks must be curbed in some way.... Always
here when you need my advice.... Hum-m....
The sooner the better.”</p>

<p>On hanging up the receiver, he turned with his invariable
kindness to Dolores. “It is time you take another of those
walks along the Drive that bring the roses into your cheeks.
I have an important conference. Stay out in the air an
hour or more.”</p>

<p>The girl put on her hat and coat. Although she suspected
that these absences were not suggested entirely on her account,
she was grateful for the half of a thought which
made them serve two purposes. As one way of showing her
appreciation, she tried always to time her strolls to his convenience
rather than her own&mdash;to return not too late for
the performance of her duties, nor soon enough to interrupt
the “conferences” continually held with handsomely gowned
women of the congregation. Never did she reënter the
study until the limousine or touring car which had brought
the visitor of the hour had purred away from the side door.</p>

<p>To-day she found the parkway paths delightful. A tinge
of winter in the air showed in the white breath of the river
craft scudding along against the tide. They always seemed
a moral to Dolores, those boats scudding along against
the tide.</p>

<p>A thought of the work piled on her desk cut her walk
to a scant hour. To her disappointment a gray town-car
stood at the annex curb. Inside she strolled up the corridors,
wondering where she should wait. Around a turn she came
upon Mr. Brill, the over-fleshed, over-moneyed and over-old
“thorn” in Dr. Willard’s flesh. Evidently the deacon was
taking a respite from the choir trial to enjoy a cigar. As
he had been most affable on the several occasions when she
had met him in the pastor’s study, Dolores greeted him
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Caught me, didn’t you, Miss Trent?” he returned, a bad-boy
grin slinking up his baggy cheeks. “You won’t tell on
a poor addict who prefers Lady Nicotine to <i>some</i> lady sopranos?”</p>

<p>“Would that be anything to tell, Mr. Brill? Dr. Willard
fairly clouds the study. I don’t see any harm in smoking.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t see harm in anything Dr. Willard
does?” Although the “central pillar” shook with mirth, his
eyes strained at her through the double-lens glasses fastened
with a black ribbon to his lapel. “Wouldn’t you, now, join
me in a puff or two or three?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. No, thank you,” said Dolores.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly. You just said you see no harm in it.
Everybody smokes nowadays, the women as much as the
men.”</p>

<p>“I know, Dr. Brill, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But if you have scruples, I’ll be only too glad to swear
that <i>I</i> won’t tell. Come, we’ll have a little social puff and
chat.”</p>

<p>Dolores tried to be good-natured, even when he gripped
her arm and propelled her into one of the small committee
rooms. When, however, he took from a gold case a slender,
perfumed cigarette, lighted it and essayed to place it between
her lips, resentment moved her.</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Brill, I never have smoked and I don’t care
to begin now. I&mdash;I must be getting back to my work.”</p>

<p>As she started from the room he lunged across a table
and caught her.</p>

<p>“But I am here to show you how. One lifts the terrible
thing in the fingers, so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His pudgy left arm caught hers. The smaller fingers of
his dimpled right hand pressed up her chin. Thumb and
forefinger sought to force between her set teeth the lip-wet
smoke. When she realized that his foot was trying to push
shut the door, an emotion new to Dolores suddenly controlled
her.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to smoke, I tell you. I don’t <i>wish</i> to be
shown.”</p>

<p>With the indignant words she beat him upon the face and
chest until he fell back gasping.</p>

<p>“Aha, a wild-cat is Nimrod’s latest trophy&mdash;a live one,
at that!”</p>

<p>Dolores remembered his chuckled comment after she had
forced back the door and rushed from the committee room.
Down the corridor and around a turn to the study she ran
without one backward glance.</p>

<p>Beside the couchant lynx she stopped, startled as looked
the couple she had interrupted. Within a scant foot of each
other stood Dr. Willard and a woman whom, somewhere,
she had seen before.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dolores’s apology stumbled as the visitor turned directly
toward her. An exquisite creature she was, slender
in her close-wrapped blue velvet, a haloesque effect created
around her silver-gold hair by the sunlight shafting from a
high window. Her blue, plumed hat lay upon a nearby
chair.</p>

<p>Dr. Willard raised a calming hand.</p>

<p>“<i>My child!</i>”</p>

<p>The emphasis laid on the familiar words as addressed to
the girl gave them an unfamiliar ring.</p>

<p>Then: “Mrs. Cabot, this is my new secretary, Miss
Trent.”</p>

<p>Dolores’ response to the introduction was automatic. She
felt confused, distressed. What an evil chance to have cut
short a clergyman’s advices to the great lady reported to have
been prostrated already by notoriety suffered on her account!
A rude return it seemed to the husband who had befriended
her.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h3>
</div>

<p>Dolores need have felt no anxiety over what she should
say. Mrs. Cabot said everything&mdash;and more.</p>

<p>“You philanthropists, will you ever get enough? Or aren’t
there that many?”</p>

<p>The short-lipped, mouse-toothed, childlike smile with
which she turned from her pastor to settle her hat in the
mirror was reflected toward them. At the door she bowed
composedly to Dolores and gave Dr. Willard her hand.</p>

<p>“In return for your wise counsel over my domestic
troubles, dear doctor, the favor you ask is small. Trust
me. I’ll steal upstairs, as if overwhelmingly attracted by
the music. But remember&mdash;you have assured me that you
like the quality of her singing voice only because some one
else does <i>not</i> like the super-quality with which she speaks.”</p>

<p>After she had gone, Dr. Willard sank into the padded
leather chair and gazed out the window. He looked disturbed;
bit his lip, as if trying to control vexation; waggled
his right foot as he was wont to do when nervous.</p>

<p>Dolores crossed the room, hesitated a moment before him,
then sank upon the hassock placed conveniently in front of
his chair.</p>

<p>“Scold me&mdash;I’d rather you would!” she exclaimed, a catch
in her voice. “I shouldn’t have burst in on your conference
that way, but I just couldn’t help it. I was so angry that
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Angry? <i>You</i>, my child?”</p>

<p>So cleared of all vexation were the yellow-brown eyes
bent to her imploring look, that Dolores began to stammer
out the cause of her agitation. When her head dropped to
her hands upon his knee, he reached out and patted her on
the shoulder, very, very kindly.</p>

<p>“Poor orphan. Poor child,” he encouraged her. “I am
indignant that such a scene could be forced upon an inexperienced
girl within these walls. No matter how great may
be Deacon Brill’s influence in the temporal affairs of the
church, I shall bring him to book in my own time and my
own way. Do not fear to tell me all.”</p>

<p>Dolores told him.</p>

<p>Shaken from her usual reticence, she also told him of
her feeling of aloneness since her father had died and the
positive fear that was growing in her&mdash;fear of the world
and its ways.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she suggested, “the unpleasant things which
have happened to me are partly my own fault.”</p>

<p>“Your fault? You feel you have faults?” A glint lighted
the agate gaze as he questioned her.</p>

<p>“I lack,” she confessed, “religion. It was left out of my
life. My father was, I think, embittered against it. He was
very good to me, but he didn’t send me to Sunday school
any more than to public school. Perhaps if he had, I’d
have grown up more like other girls&mdash;more self-reliant, less
afraid.”</p>

<p>“And less yourself,” he objected. “You have, I think,
remarkable self-control.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know how glad I am to hear you say so, Dr.
Willard. That has been my only religion&mdash;self-control. It
is very strange that a person to whom I never spoke&mdash;whom
I never saw but once&mdash;gave me the ambition to learn it.”</p>

<p>At his show of interest, Dolores recited the incident. “I
was quite a small girl, eight or nine, I guess. My father
had left me to wait in a railway station one day. I was
worried because often he&mdash;because I was afraid we’d miss
our train. There was a lady sitting near me, also waiting.
I took to watching her.</p>

<p>“She was attractive and wore nice clothes. I became
fascinated by the way she breathed, not out and in, as I had
supposed all people did, but up and down. The lace jabot
on her breast would move up and down, up and down.
Of course, as I grew older, I realized that she breathed that
way from tight lacing. But at the time it seemed to me more
refined than the common way. And then I saw that she
was going to sneeze. I’ve always hated to see people sneeze&mdash;they
make such a fuss. But this lady prepared. She was
quite calm. The jabot lifted high with the breath she took.
At the vital moment she was ready.”</p>

<p>“And did she sneeze, my poor child?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, doctor, but so neatly. She just leaned out and
did it without any fuss at all. Afterward, she didn’t sniff
or even wipe her eyes. She was very wonderful. I often
think of her.”</p>

<p>Shyly Dolores glanced up to see if the great intelligence
had anticipated her point.</p>

<p>“The station was draughty. When my turn came, I
breathed up and down and prepared. I made up my mind
to sneeze the lady’s way. And I did. And afterward, the
ambition to sneeze her way applied to other things&mdash;decided
me to take the draughts of life neatly&mdash;to be prepared and
make no fuss. I try and try, Dr. Willard. But I guess
self-control is not enough. Don’t you think people would
understand me better if I had your religion? Is it too late
for me to learn it now?”</p>

<p>“Emphatically not, you fatherless child.” The doctor
apparently had been touched by her conversational offering.
Real feeling quivered on the face bent over hers. “And there
are other comforts it is not too late for you to learn. Lean
your lonely heart against mine. Let me teach you a father’s
love.”</p>

<p>“If you would&mdash;oh, if you only would!” She seized his
hands and pressed one cheek against them. “It is so easy to
learn from one you absolutely trust.”</p>

<p>“Don’t trust anyone absolutely. I fear at times that your
rating of me is too high.” Humility tore from her reverential
regard the pastor’s eyes, although his hands shook
with appreciation of her praise. “Remember how everything
finite that goes up must come down. Only the soul can
ascend and stay on high. The flowers that lift their heads
to bloom must wither and die. The lightest feather in the
most buoyant breeze eventually returns to the earth from
which it blew.”</p>

<p>“But it is my soul you will exalt, dear Dr. Willard.”</p>

<p>At her reminder, one of his hands moved to where its palm
fitted over the ball of her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Let me be a father to you. Yes, let me be a father to
you,” he kept repeating. The while, his palm pressed her
shoulder, began to move around and around.</p>

<p>“And you’ll teach me your religion?”</p>

<p>Dolores’ head threw back in exhilarating hope. As one
performs small acts in the largest moments, she plucked a
long, silver-gold hair off the black cloth of his coat. In the
same motion, despite her boasted control of impulse, her
hand continued around his neck.</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> religion, child? I’ll gladly teach if you&mdash;if you
care to learn,” he responded, drawing her to him in a close
and closer embrace.</p>

<p>“It means safety to me&mdash;everything. You won’t find me
dull. I believe I shall learn readily from you.”</p>

<p>“I believe&mdash;you could.” The palm over the ball of her
shoulder pressed harder; moved faster. “But, dear daughter,
don’t place me or any man upon too high a pedestal,
lest we fall&mdash;lest we fall.”</p>

<p>“I am sure&mdash;&mdash;” To avoid contradicting her mentor, the
pupil altered the form of her statement. “I <i>hope</i> that you
never will fall.”</p>

<p>“And I hope&mdash;you don’t get&mdash;that hope!”</p>

<p>With the hoarse exclamation, Dr. Willard rose to his feet,
drew the girl after him and clutched her with a vehemence
that made them stand as one. Before she could draw
away her face or realize that suddenly she was again afraid,
she felt his mustache against her cheek.</p>

<p>“We’ll seal the bargain, my child. Just the kiss of a
father&mdash;the kiss of a father,” he rasped close to her ear.</p>

<p>The insult crushed upon her mouth was not, however,
fatherly. The unequal struggle started by it was of no
spiritual excitation. How she wrenched herself away from
him; how he headed off her rush toward the door; how
she eluded his clutching pursuit in and out among the other
young animals he had trapped; how she escaped from their
stumble over the couchant lynx, left him panting on the floor,
ran screaming like the hunted thing he had made of her
into the corridor and up the first flight of stairs&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The full horror of what had happened did not come to
her until she stood before the astonished music committee.
Her hair dishevelled, her waist torn open down the front, her
discretion in shreds, she flamed upon them.</p>

<p>“When even a minister of the gospel can’t be trusted,
where&mdash;<i>where</i> am I to go?”</p>

<p>That Mrs. Cabot still was with them further unnerved
her. Collapsing into a chair, struggling with hysteria, she
sobbed out her denunciation. When able to look among the
faces of the group gathered about her, she saw that all were
grave excepting two. Mrs. Cabot looked entertained, Mr.
Brill triumphant.</p>

<p>The manner that befits an occasion gave the deacon greater
weight as he turned to address his colleagues.</p>

<p>“Brothers, I have long suspected that the feet of the god
set up by this congregation are of clay. I hesitated to voice
so distressing a thought, lest I err. None of you, however,
can doubt the testimony just heard and seen. The hardest-hearted
of you can have only pity for the courageous young
woman who has exposed this aide of the Evil One. Dumbfounded
though you may be, I ask you to act with me now&mdash;<i>at
once</i>. There is not space within these hallowed walls to
house both him and me. Five minutes should give him time
to choose between a church trial or immediate resignation.
In either case, it is important that we give the news to Park
Row at once, before he who is so fond of sensation has
time to discredit us. Brothers, shall we wait upon the
pastor in the sanctum which he has so disgraced?”</p>

<p>While the honest laymen of All Mankind discussed this
drastic proposal, Brill addressed himself to the girl.</p>

<p>“A man can scarcely be expected to understand the outraged
state of your feelings, Miss Trent. But at least I realize
that you must shrink from the idea of facing that wolf in
sheep’s clothing again. I’ll send your wraps up here. Also,
it seems to me inadvisable for your own sake that you remain
in the employ of the church. In this envelope I have sealed
the equivalent of a month’s wages.... Oh, do not hesitate
to take it! Notice or money is due a dismissed employee.”</p>

<p>Glancing over-shoulder and seeing that the committee had
congregated near the door in animated argument, he made
his considerable figure the silencer of a low-voiced apology.</p>

<p>“Sorry I teased you about the cigarette, little girl. I had
an object which you did not at the time suspect&mdash;to discover,
through you, more about that scoundrel. I was trying
you out, just as the soprano was being tried out upstairs,
to see whether he had got you into the bad habit of smoking.
Didn’t blame you at all when you scratched and bit,
so you mustn’t hold it against me. You appear to be a
young woman of sterling character&mdash;a mighty good little
girl.”</p>

<p>Bending and beaming, he patted her on the head. The
eyes wontedly so nondescript above the billowy face and
cascade of chins, squinted through their double lenses benevolently.</p>

<p>“You’ll be wanting other employment,” he added in still
lower tones, as if not wishing his right hand to know. “Now,
I advise something of a&mdash;well, you know, of a little
more secular nature. Take this card, my dear. See that
you arrive at the address on it about ten to-morrow morning.
Perhaps I’ll be able to find you a berth where I can keep
a friendly eye on you. You’ll come?”</p>

<p>As he waddled out in the wake of his peers, Dolores heard
him continue: “About that matter of the soprano, brothers,
I withdraw my objection. Trouble often brings a change
of heart and I feel that we should stand together now in all
things. Especially since Sister Cabot is so decided in her
agreement with you, I’ll try to enjoy the young lady’s voice,
although I still think her too old for that churchly, newly-awakened-soul
effect. I always hold myself open to conviction.”</p>

<p>She also overheard his throaty chortles over the taunt of
Mrs. Cabot: “To younger and prettier convictions, you
mean, Deacon?”</p>

<p>Alone, Dolores stared dazedly down at the envelope and
card she held. Things happened so suddenly, once they began,
she thought. Only this morning she had chided herself
for discontent with her settled state. Now everything was
unsettled again. As she had cried out to the committee, what
manner of man dared she trust?</p>

<p>One of them had answered. The card&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Up to the light she held it. Upon it was engraved the
name and downtown business address of Deacon Brill
himself.</p>

<p>“You’ll come?” he had asked, voice, eyes, billows exuding
loving kindness.</p>

<p>Even more urgently she asked herself: “Shall I go?”</p>

<p>Next morning Dolores bought all the papers, determined
to learn the worst. Several of the more conservative merely
mentioned that the Rev. Dr. Alexander Willard had resigned
the pastorate of the Church of All Mankind. One suggested
significant detail behind the surprising act. Still
another stated that the Eminent Divine would demand an
ecclesiastical trial and introduced the name of the young
secretary whom he, disregarding a certain premonishing contretemps,
had sheltered within his church home.</p>

<p>The most sensational journal of all uncovered a photograph
of the young lady in the case and reviewed the lingerie-shop
scandal referred to by the discredited clergyman. This
was featured beneath the heading:</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">
TOO STRONG FOR<br />
DR. NIMROD’S SPORTING BLOOD
</p>

<p>Would the denomination he had served allow his reputation
to be charred by the brand he had tried so conscientiously
to pluck from the burning? So Rev. Willard was
quoted as having demanded in an exclusive interview.
Would any fair-minded congregation take, against his, the
word of an adventuress who so lately had been the example
for a reform movement instituted by one of their
most prominent parishioners, Mr. John Cabot? Was he
to be blamed that he had assumed the sincerity of All Mankind’s
ideals and had sought to make his charity wide as its
word? To save himself for sake of future good that he
might do, he would reveal, if forced, the overtures toward
him of this unholy creature. As a sacred duty he would
show his world which of the two was more sinned against
than sinning.</p>

<p>“A menace to men”&mdash;as such Dolores Trent was pointed
out by the reprimanding finger of the press.</p>

<p>Deacon Brill’s threat of Park Row had swerved from the
sheep-clothed wolf to her. Whether or not Dr. Willard lost
his pulpit, the harm to his secretary already was done.</p>

<p>In the little room found for her by her quandam benefactor,
a room in whose chintz-hung cosiness she had delighted,
Dolores decided upon her immediate course. There
were young daughters in the family of the poor parishioner.
For their sakes, she would “fold her tents” before asked to
do so and, silently as she might, steal away. Thanks to savings
from her salary and that final payment in lieu of
“notice,” she was more affluent than ever before in her life.
She would go, then. But where?</p>

<p>Opening her purse, she took out a business card and considered
it as well as its kind-spoken donor. She would come?
That had been Deacon Brill’s last question. In the absence
of alternative&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>With sudden decision, she tore the card into bits and
flung them into the waste basket. Probably she didn’t
understand men&mdash;that had been her thought. But she <i>did</i>
understand and <i>did</i> believe in the up-floating purity of the
voice of that soprano who had gone to dinner with the
music committee’s over-fleshed chairman&mdash;the young lady
who wouldn’t do.</p>

<p>No alternative?</p>

<p>The moment she cast aside what had seemed her only
chance, she found another in her fingers. Almost had she
forgotten the address given her by Patrolman Donovan
O’Shay and tucked away in her purse. For weeks she had
not thought of his “near-French” friend, Madame Marie
Sheehan. Discounted by distance was her reason for postponing
a visit to the employment office. Since her own judgment
seemed always wrong, she would try the policeman’s.
She would check herself in her “satchel” until the fates, “née
Mary Shinn,” should see fit to provide.</p>

<p>“Madame’s” French certainly was bad. There were advantages,
however, in the long lapses between the selection
of one word and her advance to the next. Dolores had ample
time to translate the high-voiced utterances overheard from
the inside room.</p>

<p>“Ah, but no! I fit the applicant to the position, not the
position to the applicant. So long you have been lacking the
employment. So quite joyful should you be for anything.
The call for companions is rare, very. One, two, three
applicants have I booked before that you come. This position
I so kindly extend&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I tell you, nothing doing!” the interruption came in emphatic,
current American. “I was a governess two days
once. I tell you I’d rather try the streets. Children ain’t
human beings. They’re devils, say I.”</p>

<p>“The devil? Ah, but no, <i>no</i>! More unto an angel is this
exquisite child. Could you once see those curls of gold,
those turquoise eyes! The parents are from money made
and them I have promised a governess to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, you redeem your promise at the expense of somebody
else. I’ll be back to-morrow for my job. Good day
to you, <i>Madame</i> Shinn!”</p>

<p>If the sneer of this would-be companion, thought Dolores,
was a sample of her companionableness, small wonder that
she was out of a position.</p>

<p>No hesitation held the girl in waiting. Ignorant of the
rules of such offices, unmindful of the dour-visaged hope-lorn
awaiting their turn on the benches of the outer room,
she brushed past the departing aspirant into madame’s
presence.</p>

<p>“Won’t you let me have that position?” she asked in lieu
of introduction. “I love children. I know I’d suit. I don’t
care so much about the pay or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So too fast you go!” interrupted née Shinn. “You look
but the infant yourself. And the qualifications&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course you couldn’t be expected to know it yet, dear
madame, but I am qualified. As for education&mdash;Listen, I
shall speak in three languages!” Under impetus of the
unwonted initiative ruling her, Dolores switched from English
to French, then to Italian as she urged: “I am young,
yes, but that is why I need a home. And what companionship
would be safer for me than that of a child such as this
golden-haired little girl you describe? Once madame was
as young as I. Was she ever, perchance, alone in the
world?”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is marvelously a linguist,” admitted Mrs.
Shinn, although confusion from more than the foreign words
sat upon her broad features. “Have you also the excellent
references?”</p>

<p>Momentarily the girl’s new-found assurance stumbled.
Then again was she inspired.</p>

<p>“I have, indeed, a par-excellent one.”</p>

<p>Her Spanish&mdash;a creditable attempt at a fourth language&mdash;may
not have been comprehensible to the agency woman, but
Donovan O’Shay’s scribble was. A good-natured smile waved
in like a flag her native tongue.</p>

<p>“A friend of Don’s are you, then, my <i>chérie</i>? Sure, if
you’re as good as that boy’s heart, you’re O. K.!”</p>

<p>Motherly instructions and penciled directions followed
Dolores’ payment of the fee. If she’d just “speak up,” now,
to Mrs. M. P. Morrison of No. &mdash;&mdash; Fifth Avenue as she
had to madame herself, she stood a chance of overcoming
natural objections to her youth and inexperience.</p>

<p>The glow of anticipated victory did not leave Dolores’
face at first sight of Mrs. Morrison’s mansion, although it
was something of a shock. Nothing should frighten her
now. She had made one friend&mdash;a woman friend. She
might&mdash;she <i>must</i> make another.</p>

<p>Briskly as though prepared for the block-front display of
lawn, unusual even on this avenue of extravagance, she
turned in through the center gateway. Under the bare trees
which she knew to be so costly a luxury, she hurried, as if
fearful that some late-clinging leaf might mistake her importance
and honor her head. Past clumps of drying hydrangeas,
past a fountain which still defied the freeze of
winter with rainbow spray, past a marble dryad of a cynical
smirk afterwards acutely remembered, she found herself confronted
by a well-balanced marble pile. Without a pause,
lest trepidation weaken her, she descended the steps to the
ground-floor entrance and pressed the bell.</p>

<p>An elderly gentleman, of such distinguished appearance
that she felt he must be the master of the house himself,
opened the door. After inspection of Madame Sheehan’s
card, he escorted her across a galleried entrance hall of a
luxury and loftiness well-nigh incredible. At the rear, he
threw open the door of a small parlor, cheerful from its
window-boxed blooming geraniums. Mrs. Morrison would
be down, he told her.</p>

<p>Dolores’ wait was not long. The tap-tap of high heels
upon the marble foyer outside brought her to her feet. She
“spoke up” according to instructions and tried to recall the
assurance which had carried her past the rules&mdash;<i>and</i> the
French&mdash;of née Shinn. She stressed her education and the
“way” she was said to have with children, especially with
little girls.</p>

<p>The more she talked, however, the more serious looked
the woman whom she hoped to make her friend.</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” said Mrs. Morrison, “that the case has
been misrepresented. Strange, when I explained to Madame
Sheehan myself, on my trip among the agencies this
morning! The child for whom I need a governess is not a
girl and has anything but the amiable disposition accredited
to him.”</p>

<p>“Madame’s French must have misled me.” Dolores chose
to ignore the particulars of “those curls of gold, those turquoise
eyes,” evidently mere chimera of a Hibernian imagination.
At the suggestion of failure she all the more craved
success. “It does not especially matter that he is not a girl.
He is a child, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morrison glanced rather suspiciously at her. “I
don’t know. The last governess called him a fiend. You are
different from the sort we have had and expected again. I
scarcely know what to say. You look a sweet-dispositioned
girl, but are very young. Perhaps I’d better leave the
decision to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Laughter and spirited repartee in the voices of a man and
a woman sounded pleasantly from the hall. They seemed
to decide her. She arose; crossed to the door; paused briefly
to say: “His mother has just come in from her ride. Perhaps
she will speak with you.”</p>

<p>“His mother? But&mdash;I thought&mdash;that you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dolores, again alone, began to understand. Of course
Mrs. Morrison was the housekeeper. That explained the
first-floor parlor, the neat black taffeta of her dress and her
subdued manner. A third application for the coveted position
must be made.</p>

<p>When, next moment, the door was pushed wide, she did
not rise. She had not the strength. A woman in a smart
habit of black velvet coat and white cloth breeches had clattered
in, crop in hand.</p>

<p>“Master Jack’s mother will speak with you, Miss Trent,”
introduced the housekeeper.</p>

<p>Still Dolores found her limbs weaker than her will. She
clung to both arms of the chair and waited for the real
sponsor for the “fiend-child” to speak.</p>

<p>She&mdash;the mother&mdash;was Mrs. Cabot.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h3>
</div>

<p>His Majesty himself dropped the curtain on the earth-play
of the spirit-girl.</p>

<p>“The only real value of a story is its effect upon yourself,”
he said. “I must have an interval in which to judge the
worth of yours.”</p>

<p>At the time Dolores felt relieved, although he had not
confused her with the interruptions and insistence of the
previous séance. He had allowed her to tell her story
her own way, swiftly and simply, and showed a positive
gravity of attention over the ecclesiastic incidents.</p>

<p>Not until the next night came and went without the call
for a third installment, did she suspect that he had been
merely bored.</p>

<p>When a second night passed with the same significant
omission and, after that, a third, fear possessed her.</p>

<p>Had she, then, fallen short of his expectations? Had she
done what he had warned her not to do&mdash;had she failed?</p>

<p>She took to staying in her chamber and hoping for his
summons more than previously she had dreaded it. Over
her babe she would hover the hours away, brooding rather
than rejoicing at each cooed assurance that the infant-shade
was content. Would the price of the respite be paid in part
by the blameless soul of her soul?</p>

<p>To her here, through the guarded gossip of the proud
Adeline, came reports of a direful activity on the part of
the King. Never had he been more exacting, more merciless
in his reversal of punishment for reward. His disposition
of that first evening during which she had waited in vain
seemed directly inspired by her reminiscences of the parson
person. In an open-air camp-meeting, “His Damnity” had
preached the first of seven announced “sermons” to a vast
concourse. Seven, it seemed, was the perfect number&mdash;a
royal superstition. Hadn’t she counted his seven courtiers,
the seven windows of the throne-room, seven courses at dinner,
seven days in his week?</p>

<p>Adeline admitted herself to have been a unit of the congregation
of fiends. The first sermon had been, to say the
least, impressive. Satan’s text had been orthodox: “<i>A star
fell from Heaven unto the earth; and to him was given the
key of the bottomless pit.</i>” He had attacked the letter of
The Law. To be saved by “believing”&mdash;how vain a promise
when to that Star of Heaven was given the key to the pit
into which all eventually would be hurled who had been
born heirs to sin!</p>

<p>Over Omnipotent Egotism he had ranted himself into a
rage which had made his audience tremble. Fire flashed
from his nostrils, his eyes, his finger-tips, as he compared
his own indefatigable assertiveness with the retirement into
the Light of the Great-I-Am. How dare He sit back, smug
over his one noteworthy achievement&mdash;the Creation?</p>

<p>The Law of Redemption, pah! What were laws that were
not enforced&mdash;mere vague threats of a future state? He
asked consideration of the handling of his own first law
as keeper of the pit key. Did he ever delay collection of the
wages of sin? Angel worship was forbidden and he didn’t
expect them to worship him. But they could fear him and,
fearing, must serve him. He advised them to hitch their
hope-wagons to that fallen star&mdash;“their archangel in eclipse
and the excess of glory obscured.”</p>

<p>Truly this departure in infernal propaganda must have
been fearsome. Also fearsome was Dolores’ wonder over
why she alone had not been bidden to attend. Adeline was
inclined to attribute the omission to stage fright. M’lord,
remembering the standard to which his entertainer had been
educated, feared to fall short. Having successfully tried out
his “delivery,” however, he probably would ask her to the
second sermon of the seven.</p>

<p>But what of the two intervening nights? Why this surcease
of interest in the griefs which so had diverted him?</p>

<p>Dolores was forced to the conclusion that she had ceased
to entertain. Perhaps, even then, the evil eye was sighting
her fate and the fate of her babe.</p>

<p>Desperation shook her from the stupor of waiting. He
had preached action in his sermon, according to report. She
must <i>do</i> something to re-arouse his curiosity. In the late
afternoon, as she knew, he often strolled in his favorite
garden of Bad Luck. She dared not ask for an appointment;
no. Yet why not “happen” to meet him?</p>

<p>In selecting the rays in which to dress, she remembered
his preference for purples and scarlets, rather than the more
delicate half-lights in which she would have clothed herself.
But even while thanking Adeline for a grudging compliment
over the blend of her robe with the purplish shadows of
her eyes, she realized the depths to which she was sinking.
For the first time she understood those women of earth who
adorned themselves to enslave men whom they had come to
hate. Those they feared most, they must charm. Poor, <i>poor</i>
women of Earth!</p>

<p>In the lower reaches of the garden she came upon an
illustration of her thought&mdash;a fountain effect whose central
figure was the sculped, naked body of a woman bent beneath
the club of her man and master, on her lips a seductive smile,
from her eyes spouting twin founts of electric spray&mdash;tears
of terror.</p>

<p>Hearing footsteps behind, Dolores stopped, as if in admiration
of the ghoulish conceit. The throb of her temples
was not cooled by the hot winds with which the tropical
foliage illusions of the garden were artificially fanned. The
sinking sensation at her heart was no sickness from the too-intense
odors of the lavish-looking bloom. The hurt of her
ears could not be blamed on shrieks of the peacocks, parrakeets
and tanagers which soundlessly strutted and winged
about. No winds of Gehenna might discomfort her, except
in her own acknowledgment. No odors, except from memory,
might penetrate her senses from poinsettias or rhododendrons.
No sound, except as she imagined it, might swell the
throats of the birds. From the rubber plants grouped at the
entrance gate, through the lane of Spanish bayonets whose
barbs were a menace to one who strolled, to the fountain
called “Fate of the Fair,” the garden was one vast stage
set, a master chimera. Bad luck, then&mdash;that too must be
hallucination.</p>

<p>Courage came to Dolores with the thought. She, an immortal
woman soul, would not bow the neck to an undeserved
club. She must lift her head believing that even the winds
of Hell would cool her brow; must delight in fragrances,
strong from her own expectation; must open wide her ears
to the Seraphs’ song of hope.</p>

<p>Ready to meet His Majesty, she turned. Her disappointment
was keen as her courage to see in him who was approaching
the lame old soldier-soul, Samuel Cummings. At
first only his face and crutch were recognizable, so resplendent
was he in the uniform of an officer of the Hadean
Hordes. When he drew up before her with his old-time
salute, she counted on his forehead, branded blood-red, the
stars of a general.</p>

<p>Her maid had told him he’d find her out here, the old chap
explained. He had come to tell her the news. His Majesty
had called him to an interview night before last and promoted
him because it was beneath the Royal dignity to confer
in private with a corporal.</p>

<p>So Old Sam, then, had supplanted her as entertainer.</p>

<p>As if in answer to Dolores’ thought, he motioned with
his crutch toward a bench of opalesque stone that stood beneath
an arbor of purple bourgainvillae. The honor paid
him, he declared, was only the preface to his news. When
seated beside her, however, he seemed loathe to proceed;
glanced uneasily among the flowers of an oleander bush
which changed color with alternating currents of red and
white.</p>

<p>His “news,” he at last confessed in guarded tones, concerned
herself. Dangerous though a report might be, he felt
one his duty. His summons into The Presence had been to
discuss her. His Highness had reintroduced the subject of
“Grief to Men” and asked the veteran’s opinion on a number
of her points. Did Sam think her the most beautiful woman
he ever had seen? Did he consider her deep or just dumb?
In what, according to a recent earthling, lay her chief charm?</p>

<p>On the whole, declared the old new general, Satan had
acted a good deal as would some human swain who was
getting interested in a girl. With men, he wasn’t such a bad
sort as Sam had expected. But with women&mdash;&mdash; There
never was any telling what&mdash;&mdash; She&mdash;she understood?</p>

<p>At his embarrassed glance, she nodded. What woman had
better reason to understand than she?</p>

<p>“One question he asked was why I thought you never
smiled,” the simple soul continued solemnly. “That stumped
me. As I told him, Mary Gertrude used to be one laugh
from morn till eve. ‘Odd,’ said he, ‘when she’s caused all
those griefs.’”</p>

<p>“I never learned to smile,” said Dolores. “My father
never did. He used to laugh sometimes. It was terrible to
hear him. But he never smiled.”</p>

<p>The wag of Old Sam’s head was rueful. “I don’t want
to worry you, but I feel I should tell you what he called
you&mdash;his ‘latest flame in the land of such.’ And he asked
me if I thought that a woman who had ruined so many humans
could be of any use to an immortal&mdash;some real bad
one, say, who had a good thing to offer her. I reminded
him of the Littlest Devil. ‘Oh, the B. B.,’ says he. ‘Likely
she did make one of them happy for a while. That isn’t
what I mean. My thoughts of her are pure&mdash;pure as Hell.’
Ma’am, I can’t figure it out any other way than that he’s got
a weakness for you.”</p>

<p>“Please&mdash;<i>please</i> don’t say that!”</p>

<p>Dolores shuddered as though shaken by the torrid breeze,
then withdrew from his side to the outmost end of the bench.
Some unseen force had moved her. Grateful though she
felt for his effort to forearm her, she found herself unable
to reassure him. A hateful reluctance stayed her tongue.</p>

<p>Came startling interpolation: “<i>All has been overheard.</i>”</p>

<p>The words were spoken in a voice which both recognized.
There materialized to their vision the superb face and figure
of His Satanic Majesty. He was seated between them.</p>

<p>“Eavesdropping is old stuff, I know,” he remarked easily,
“but it never ceases to be.”</p>

<p>“It was you who forced me aside?” Dolores struggled
with her indignation. “I didn’t know you could make yourself
invisible.”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you <i>didn’t</i> know, then. Turning oneself on
or off is a trick that our late angel did not lose in his fall.
Fancy one of the Cherubim reduced to turning himself off
and on in lowlands like Gehenna!”</p>

<p>With angry intolerance, he faced toward General Sam.
“What’s this you were saying about me? A weakness&mdash;<i>I</i>?”</p>

<p>“A man’s weakness for his woman is his strength,” the
soldier-soul contended.</p>

<p>“Your tongue tangles when you measure my strength by
that of men. I am&mdash;&mdash;” and Satan’s glance slashed out like
a sword&mdash;“I am the Destroyer. Fool, fear me!” Irritably
he added: “Who do you think you are&mdash;Prometheus unbound?
Why do you suppose I promoted you if not to get
rid of you without breaking my pact with Dame Dolores?
Get yourself to the nearest army camp, and make believe
you’ve earned your commission. See you stay there, too,
until I send for you.”</p>

<p>“But what about my appointment in the palace? Who
will hold the bowl for Your Highness’ tears?”</p>

<p>The King arose as though further enraged by the reminder,
then succumbed to a sort of paroxysm so violent
that his utterance was impeded.</p>

<p>“Tears&mdash;and over Dolores’ griefs to men? Now I know
you are a fool. To have taken me seriously when I called
myself a crocodile! I to weep&mdash;and over human nature?
Excuse me, folks. Let me enjoy myself while I’m young.
Honestly, I near injure my sides every time I think of what
she put over on that high-priest of the Great-I-Am!”</p>

<p>Too preoccupied was he to return his new-made general’s
salute. Not until the sound of Old Sam’s peg-leg had ceased
to punctuate the pause did he reseat himself upon the bench.</p>

<p>“As for you, designing jade&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>In the very midst of his address, he became lost in contemplation
of the royal toes. The girl-shade beside him realized
that not once to-day had he looked directly at her.
She was reminded painfully of an earthling who had been
strong toward all his world, yet weak toward her. He <i>must</i>
not have that sort of weakness for her&mdash;Satan. He must
look at her. She leaned toward him and tried to smile.
But he would not meet her eyes. Hideous it was that he
should ape the mannerism toward her of that one she had
cared for most on earth.</p>

<p>Long it seemed before he completed his remark.</p>

<p>He had her at last, he declared; had preferred not to see
or hear her again until he had her. Now he was ready to
take up with her the matter of her status in Shadow Land.
Had she wondered why she was the only soul about the
court not more or less tormented? The answer was easy.
Torment wasted power. He chuckled; then, on noting that
he chuckled alone, frowned. Had she no sense of humor?</p>

<p>At her ingenuous acknowledgment of her lack in that
respect, the Satanic brow cleared. To know that she had
not humor was humor in itself. Positively the most comical
thing about the story of her life was that she could be so
serious over it now that she was dead. Henceforth he should
not expect anything in her but soul. He had a beautiful soul
himself. But he didn’t let it interfere with his daily pleasures.</p>

<p>At first he had attributed his interest in her to the correlative
facts that she was a fallen woman and he a fallen
angel. When, later, he had come to realize her desirability
to devils in general, he had searched for a more comprehensive
reason.</p>

<p>To his way of looking, she was pleasant to the eye. But
beauty was a matter of taste. To a Zulu she wouldn’t
compare with his thick-lipped, black-hued mate. The Cabot’s
housekeeper, Mrs. Morrison, might be right in accrediting
her with a sweet disposition. Yet weren’t unattractive girls
usually called “sweet” and “good-natured”? She appeared to
be unselfish&mdash;and where was there an attribute so tiresome
in women as unselfishness? The fact that she boasted no
brilliancy was a point in her favor. The suggestion of an
ardent nature in those dear little wrinkles around her mouth
might be either pro or con.</p>

<p>In what, then, lay her lure?</p>

<p>He had felt he should lose respect for his intelligence if
obliged to hear to the end of her story to know. He had
found the clue in the least important of her conquests&mdash;in
him she called the “city’s choice.” Why had that young
Irishman’s blood gushed to his face at the cling of her hand
upon his arm, only to recede at the look of eyes so like
those of his year-old babe? Why had he calmed into a fine
protectorate from one of those sudden physical excitements
peculiar to mortal men?</p>

<p>He had got her, had got her at last. And with her he had
got the secret of her power&mdash;a secret of inestimable value
to herself. Oh, she need not look so helpless and perturbed!
She need not maintain that pose with him, now that he understood.</p>

<p>“Exactly what is it in me&mdash;&mdash;” the dark head drooped&mdash;“that
you understand?”</p>

<p>He slashed out at an oleander until it blazed at him its bi-colored
fire.</p>

<p>“You were red and white&mdash;a human flower more attractively
charged than any in my garden of Bad Luck.” He
rose to bow before her, low and with no trace of irony.
“You were an effect unique among womankind, a combination
of unconscious lust and seductive innocence. You appealed
with equal force to the bad and the good in that creature
as near devil as angel&mdash;everyman. <i>I</i> know. Am I not
the limit in both?”</p>

<p>From gay to grave his manner again changed when he
squared around and at last faced her.</p>

<p>“Never have I destroyed any force that works for me,”
he stated. “You have powers for evil which, if developed,
might rival my own. It remains with you whether that
power increases in you or, through duress, is destroyed.
Come, what do you say?”</p>

<p>“What can I say, when I don’t know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Allow me to say it for you, then. As I have explained
in part, I need&mdash;and need in a hurry&mdash;more men souls than
I have been able to draft since the conception of my Great
Intention. Although I’ve never been above taking any outside
help I can get, I always have despised the retroaction
upon men of women. Since Eve, the fair have been a sickly
lot, more given to good influences than bad. Even the experts
developed by modern sex and social problems have
shown chiefly stupidity. Not the worst of them but have
ideas of <i>bona fide</i> reform back of the rows they’re raising.
As for the vampires, real ones always have been rare. That
Catherine Cabot, to whom you’ve called my attention, is exceptional.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Dr. Shayle used to say that Catherine couldn’t be
‘reached’.”</p>

<p>“Shayle&mdash;is that the name of the ruined healer on your
passport?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the world was mistaken about him, Your Majesty.
Dear Clarke Shayle&mdash;he said I saved him.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope not, you slave to tradition!” His Highness
snapped. “If you knew the deplorable failure I’ve made
trying to get bad results from women, you’d agree that I’d
best stick to my last&mdash;and first&mdash;the men. However, since
you’ve been séancing with me evenings, certain possibilities
of making your sex serve my purposes have opened up before
me. In the past my idea has been that the more I
could keep women under, the worse the world would be.
You have changed my slogan to ‘Turn ’em loose’.”</p>

<p>“<i>I?</i>”</p>

<p>For a moment Satan enjoyed the admixture of humbleness
and indignation in her query.</p>

<p>“Nice work,” he commented. “Such feminism may be
made the most dynamic evil in the universe by one who
masters it. De Maupassant thought he had, but his ideas of
women were limited to types of his time. I have the one
mind that can look at your sex unbiased by sentiment. As
I had no mother, all women are before, none behind me.
The male may go on and on indefinitely with sex villainies.
But the female is likely to learn from one indecency, her
Swan Song, as it were. Yet her lamentable limitations need
not discourage us, since wars have made the fair population
exceed&mdash;shall I say, the foul? ‘By their works ye shall
know them.’ Your works I know. Ergo, I know you. Unlike
your friend of the employment agency, I fit the position
to the applicant. Here is the job I had created for you.”</p>

<p>He would make her manager, accountable only to himself,
of the woman’s department of the mortal world; would teach
her the psychology of spiritual communication, so that she
might personally direct important cases, as did he in his own
field; would place under her charge a school of female fiends
whom she might entrust with missions on earth as soon as
she deemed them sufficiently proficient in her subtleties,
even as he did his demon sleuths.</p>

<p>To appeal, to obtain, to destroy&mdash;was not that the mission
of her sex? And yet so long had women been burden-bearers,
deprived of initiative by the master’s rein and hoppled
by the ultimate of man-made laws, that even he who so
sorely needed them, had failed to appreciate their suppressed
power. Never would they come into their own until they
learned that their capability lay, not in trying to be what
they were not, but in being essentially and ruthlessly what
they were.</p>

<p>“Ah, wrigglier than a she-cobra’s wriggle is the female of
my dreams!” Glowing from that ruddy mist of concentration
which once before Dolores had seen, His Highness
warmed to his thought. “If all the anarchists in my incubators
were matured, they’d be a puny menace to society and
the State as compared with women let loose. Take the punitive
laws from any class and what is the result? Riot,
bestiality, sin. Fear is what has held women down. Take
away fear and what will they do? They’ll master the men.
Once give ’em license and they’ll soon make up for their
enforced virtue of the past. The fact that they do not originate
is their best-worst trait&mdash;saves a lot of energy. Why,
when I contemplate their daring, their imperviousness to
pain, their concentration through heredity upon the meaner
issues; when I allow myself to imagine the deafening pop
of the bottled-up indignities poured upon them in the past&mdash;<i>Whew!</i>
I, the First and Last, shudder in humility over my
virtues. This I give you as a prophecy: To the female of
the species is the victory of vice.”</p>

<p>Dolores was lifted above fear for herself by fear for
womankind.</p>

<p>“For shame!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Shame? What is that?”</p>

<p>“What I feel for you, Your&mdash;Your Lowness.”</p>

<p>“Good! I <i>must</i> be getting bad. It is well that you pay me
an out-loud compliment now and then, when I’m paying you
with the utmost of my unlimited power. You encourage me
to proceed. Although I don’t wish you to doff your gentle
ways&mdash;they’ll serve as a model for your she-destroyers&mdash;you
must keep clearly in mind that our chief emotion down here
is hate&mdash;immortal hate.”</p>

<p>“Hate immortal? I find it hard to think of such a thing.
I am sure that I never could hate for long. On Earth, I
might stay angry with some one through the day, but I
couldn’t go to sleep until I forgave.”</p>

<p>His Majesty scowled down at her, evidently disturbed.
“It’s all right to look that idea. Of course you don’t feel
it. You certainly must hate these earthlings you’re telling us
about.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong. I don’t hate them. Somehow I can’t
hate any of them.” With a catch of breath, she added: “If
you said immortal love, now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, my child. Isn’t it hot enough down here?
Don’t heat up my imagination.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t you ever feel love for anybody?”</p>

<p>“No, nor wouldn’t if I could. Love is weakening&mdash;orangeade
for temperance fools like General Sam. What is
it anyhow? Some old scientist has defined it as ‘merely the
attraction of billions of atoms, electrically charged in the
system, corresponding to the same number of the same sort
of atoms in a person of the opposite sex.’ There you have
it. What is so marvelous about that&mdash;what to make such a
to-do over?”</p>

<p>“That definition doesn’t sound right to me.”</p>

<p>Dolores’ eyes gazed out over the garden with a waiting
look. It was as if, within their shadows of a purple that
shamed the bourgainvillae bloom, hope was hiding in the
arbor.</p>

<p>The King watched her in his considering way. His arm
stretched along the back of the bench. When convinced that
she had forgotten his presence, he suddenly snapped his
strong, long fingers around the nape of her neck.</p>

<p>With a smothered scream, Dolores tried to shake off his
clutch. Never from a mortal man had she felt a touch so
offensive, yet so loathsomely attracting.</p>

<p>“Please release me. You are so&mdash;so intense!”</p>

<p>“Quite too intense”&mdash;Satan drew back his lips over his
teeth in a bestial smile&mdash;“and in the imperative tense. Remember,
Dame Dolores, that what I want, I do not ask. I
take.”</p>

<p>Sliding his hand down her arm, he drew her to her feet.</p>

<p>“Considering that, how do you like the prospect of this
High Priestess job?”</p>

<p>“I simply couldn’t do such things as you propose,” she
dared his displeasure to protest. “I should fail dismally, for
I am not at heart the sort you think. You say that love
weakens one, but my spirit would die, I know, if I cast love
out and tried to hate. You would be disappointed in me
and your plans planned in vain. If success is what you
demand, choose some one stronger in hate than I&mdash;some one
who&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Playing in form to the last!” he commented. “You are
wise. There really is no comparison between this appointment
and one to the Wanton’s Well or, say, the Traitors to
Mothers. You, by the way, are a native daughter to the
last-named state. Did that strike you the other day? According
to your own account, you killed your mother before
the poor thing could so much as say ‘top o’ the morning.’”</p>

<p>“At least let me think it over. Let me finish the séances
first,” Dolores plead, under the iron of his reminder. “I am
exhausted each night when they are over and busy all the
next day planning how best I may continue to entertain
Your Lowness. A new undertaking might make me a
failure in both.”</p>

<p>“There is something to that, unless&mdash;&mdash;” He peered
down at her suspiciously. “You’re not aspiring to outwit me
by dragging out that life story indefinitely? The new job
<i>will</i> tax your concentration, no doubt of it. And you do
look all in after your regular evening stunt. All right. You
may have one week after the end of the séances in which to
make up such of your mind as I have not made up for you.
But I say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, Your&mdash;&mdash; Yes, Pluto?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you the dearest of griefs?” Although he laughed
at the guile with which she had thanked him for his concession,
he finished the warning sternly. “See you make
your story snappy to-night. Don’t let these days of grace&mdash;or
disgrace&mdash;make you as profuse of unessential details as
you’ve been chary of the essentials past nights. If you do,
you’ll find yourself talking against time with a vengeance.
A vengeance&mdash;get that?”</p>

<p>Yes, she assured him, her voice a minor chord. And she
would try to make it “snappy.”</p>

<p>A weakness for her? As compared with the strength he
was showing to bend or break her to his will, that dread
now seemed a hope.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h3>
</div>

<p>In the long moment during which Mrs. Cabot leveled her
astonished stare upon the applicant as governess to her son,
the girl did not breathe. When direct demand was made of
her she could not speak.</p>

<p>“Tell me, is coming here your own idea? Or did my
husband&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>The smart vision in black and white interrupted herself
by an over-shoulder invitation.</p>

<p>“Come in, Henri. Be moved to admiration of my John.
Even you will concede that he is improving.”</p>

<p>To the personage in blue-gray uniform who clattered at
her side, she added:</p>

<p>“You have the privilege of viewing at close range the
famed Dolores Trent.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the mademoiselle which Meestaire Cabot have
rescue?” inquired the French cavalry officer.</p>

<p>“The same. Is there anything like rescuing a lady, my
dear d’Elie, to excite a man’s interest in her? He is pleased
with her because pleased with himself&mdash;so pleased that he
wants to keep right on rescuing her. I might have known
that John would locate the disappearing heroine of his hero
act sooner or later. But how naïvely American to try to
make a convenience of his own home!”</p>

<p>In Dolores’ silence Mrs. Morrison denied the charge.</p>

<p>“Miss Trent was sent here through Madame Sheehan’s
agency, to which I frequently apply. Up to the moment you
came in just now, Mrs. Cabot, she thought me the mother
of the child in need of a governess. I assure you that Mr.
Cabot had nothing to do with her application.”</p>

<p>An arpeggio of light laughter, accompanied by a bass
chord, greeted this defense.</p>

<p>“No use talking, she’s <i>good</i>, isn’t she?” Mrs. Cabot asked
her escort, before turning directly to Dolores. “But I fear,
Miss Trent, that you’re not quite good enough. A mother
owes something to her child, even though a father thinks
that he does not. I thank you for coming. You have succeeded
better than our parson friend’s lynx in giving me a
rare sensation&mdash;that of surprise. I wish you a very good
morning.”</p>

<p>Dolores rose; heard a quiet voice making her reply.</p>

<p>“And I am sorry that I came. I shouldn’t have done so
had I understood. I hope you will believe Mrs. Morrison,
if not me, for Mr. Cabot’s sake. Good morning.”</p>

<p>On her way to the entrance, the purport of a rapid exchange
in French between him named as d’Elie and Mrs.
Cabot was forced upon her realization.</p>

<p>“Pardon, adored one, but have you considered the other
needs of your household?”</p>

<p>“What other needs could there be in which this celebrated
miss is concerned?”</p>

<p>“Only yesterday madame was saying that her husband
seemed afflicted with ennui&mdash;that it might be advisable to
stimulate his interest in life. Might it not prove pleasant,
my angel, if the father of the infant terrible should find
the new governess&mdash;shall I say, <i>congenial</i>?”</p>

<p>“Enough, my clever Henri. I understand.”</p>

<p>So complete was the change of manner with which Mrs.
Cabot stopped the girl at the door that a more experienced
person could scarcely have been blamed for bewilderment.
Her cynical expression was lost in a humid smile. Her voice
softened. She tossed aside the crop with which she had
been swishing the air to extend the hand of appeal.</p>

<p>“The Marquis d’Elie has criticized my lack of charity,”
she said. “Perhaps I <i>am</i> wrong to jump at conclusions.
And it is a responsibility to send a mere child like you back
into a world which already has been rather hard on her.
Then, too, my unfortunate offspring is to be considered. It
is quite possible that he might get along better with a young
person than the nursery monitors he so often has defeated.
I wonder if you are as amiable as you look&mdash;if you could
forgive the hasty things I said just now?”</p>

<p>Dolores did not know what to think, still less what to
say. She parried by a question which interested her.</p>

<p>“You call your son unfortunate. What is the matter
with him?”</p>

<p>Catherine Cabot’s first talent was that of taking. Whatever
she wanted in life she took as her perquisite. Always
had she taken admiration, service, flattery, love, sacrifice,
money. Literally she had taken her husband because he
was useful to her. She proceeded now to take Dolores
Trent.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, if you could know how unfortunate! Most
children have some sort of a chance, but not my poor Jackie.
Probably after you have seen him and know something of
the disposition that comes from his sufferings, you won’t
wish to undertake him. You would need a love for children
great enough to include the most unlovable.”</p>

<p>“But I have a great love for children,” Dolores said. “My
neighbors used to say that I have a way with them.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cabot would be relieved of his heaviest burden if
we’d find some one who could handle Jack.” Catherine continued
her “taking.” “It would seem like a fatality, wouldn’t
it, if in return for his small service to you that day at
Seff’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“His service wasn’t small, Mrs. Cabot. I may have
seemed ungrateful not to thank him, but I&mdash;&mdash; You
see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course you couldn’t and of course he didn’t wish you
to,” the wife assured her. “But it would be really beautiful&mdash;sort
of nice and Emersonian&mdash;if you could pass along
the favor he did you to his child. Suppose you hold an
open mind, Miss Trent, until after you’ve met Jack. I’ll
come to his rooms later and help to explain him. Morrison
will take up all details with you, if you should decide to
stay. Won’t you try, anyhow, to forget and forgive my
unkindness?”</p>

<p>The girl, still standing just within the door, heard the
Frenchman’s congratulation, as the brilliant-looking pair disappeared
among the palms of the foyer.</p>

<p>“But you are wonderful, my adored one, most wonderful!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As Dolores stepped off the elevator onto the third-floor
balcony that overlooked the great, glass-domed hall, a
woman’s scream cut the quiet. The housekeeper hurried
ahead and threw open the door of a large, sun-flooded room.</p>

<p>“He have bite me, Mees Morrison. But see this mark on
my wrist. I should regret to desert madame, but I give
up my place rather than play as the nurse one hour longer.”</p>

<p>The plaint arose from a be-capped young woman whom
Dolores later learned to be Annette, Mrs. Cabot’s maid,
pressed into emergency service. She had made a shield of
a light chair between herself and the boy of eight, or thereabouts,
who was pursuing her. The bone of their contention
seemed to be a particularly boneless toy dog held above his
reach.</p>

<p>Dolores’ first view of John Cabot, Jr., was not heartening.
His only recognition of her presence was a scowl. In lurching
forward over the chair to recapture his plaything, he
slipped and fell, with a shriek more of chagrin than pain,
upon the floor. When Morrison and Annette rushed to his
assistance, Dolores intervened. She asked that they leave
her alone with the boy.</p>

<p>After the closing click of the door she crossed to one
of the windows; seated herself in an upholstered chair; gave
her attention to the park view.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come and pick me up?”</p>

<p>At the demand, she turned to see that Master Jack still
sprawled on the floor, his chin cupped in his hands, his
unchildlike frown upon her.</p>

<p>“I didn’t suppose you’d wish to be picked up&mdash;a big boy
like you,” she said. “I didn’t suppose you’d even wish me
to look at you.”</p>

<p>She regretted the ruse the moment she realized his physical
handicap. Having challenged his pride, however, she hesitated
to retreat. But an ache for him which never was entirely
eased came into her heart as she watched his efforts
to achieve his feet; noted the warped condition of his legs;
watched his peculiar gait as he approached her&mdash;a slithering
forward of his feet, with no yield at his knees and hips.</p>

<p>Jack’s upper body was only fairly developed, yet by comparison
with his nether limbs his arms looked excessively
long. His head, with its luxurious growth of dark brown,
slightly curling hair, was large as a gnome’s. At the
moment his features were twisted into an expression of
resentment. Only his eyes were beautiful, wide-set and
Irish-gray in color, with an outsweep of long, almost black
lashes.</p>

<p>A certain embarrassment for him, which quickly followed
the shock of noting his deformity, caused Dolores to lift
her eyes toward a square object wrapped about with a bath
towel, which was suspended from the ceiling near the
window.</p>

<p>“A bird?” she asked irrelevantly.</p>

<p>“A canary.” Master Jack now stood directly before her.
“He sings so much around noon-time, I bag him.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you like him to sing?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. He sounds too happy. Who are you,
anyway?”</p>

<p>Dolores’ eyes filled with the wistfulness that always overflowed
her heart at thought of her own lonely childhood&mdash;her
super-sad little-girlhood.</p>

<p>“I am some one your mother has engaged to keep you
company,” she told him. “I do hope we can make a go
of it, Jack. I certainly should appreciate your friendship.”</p>

<p>“You’re not&mdash;&mdash;” Suspicion stiffened his face. “Say, if
you’re another governess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’d rather be,” she interrupted, “sort of a pal.”</p>

<p>“But you couldn’t play boy’s games. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Dolores Trent. Dolores means grief.”</p>

<p>“’Lores&mdash;grief?”</p>

<p>His interest was caught, as had been Vincent Seff’s, by
that “sad little name” of hers. He hooked one hand to his
hip like some shrunken old man and studied her from beneath
the graceful sweep of his lashes. New objection
occurred to him.</p>

<p>“My mother insists that I keep cheerful all the time. She
mightn’t let you stay if she knew your name meant grief.
She hung Dick in here. That’s one reason I don’t like him.”</p>

<p>“How you must love your mother, Jack&mdash;she’s so
beautiful!”</p>

<p>“That’s no reason to love anybody,” came his startling
statement. “I’ve been living with my mother going on nine
years now and she’s getting kind of stale. I don’t mind
your name&mdash;being kept cheerful all the time is what I hate
the most. I won’t stand it, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Dolores quieted his returning excitement with a shrug of
compliance. “Let’s just be miserable together, then.”</p>

<p>“Until that gets tiresome.” Even with the shrewd proviso,
one corner of the boy’s over-large mouth twitched, as if from
humor. “Mind, I get my own way,” he warned, “except
when John’s home.”</p>

<p>“John?” she asked.</p>

<p>“My father. He’s the only person I respect, unless it is
Clarke Shayle. I don’t know, though. I think I like Clarke
more than I respect him. And then, of course, he hurts
me a lot. Clarke’s my osteopath. He has won five medals
for swimming. John hasn’t any medals, but he doesn’t need
them. You sort of know that he could have all he wanted
if he wanted them.”</p>

<p>“And you let your father have his own way with you?”</p>

<p>“Of course, and not because he would punish me if I
disobeyed him, either. They say”&mdash;Jack drew up quaintly&mdash;“that
John worships me. As for me, I shouldn’t wish to
offend him. We’re awfully chummy, my father and I,
although he’s very tall and strong and I&mdash;&mdash;” Gulping, he
turned away. “See that wooden cradle in the corner? I’d
never have it in my rooms except that John was rocked in it
when he was a baby. Seems funny to think of John ever
having been a baby, he’s so mannish now.”</p>

<p>The Colonial antique which had distracted the little fellow’s
thoughts from himself, was the first of many interesting
treasures he showed her. Mrs. Cabot had called the
child’s quarters “rooms,” rather than “nursery,” and they
were, indeed, furnished incongruously for his years. Except
for a few mechanical toys, the suite might have been that of
some sophisticated bachelor. The chamber that opened off
the living room was filled with heirloom mahogany, the bed
a fine example of pineapple four-poster upon which not
only his father’s father, but also his great-grandfather had
slept. Oil portraits of the paternal line hung the walls.
Turkish rugs lay upon the polished floors. An old corner
clock ticked away the time for this last of the Cabots as it
had for seven generations of the name before him. He particularly
liked the clock, Jack said, because it was calm-faced&mdash;not
too sad, not too happy&mdash;just calm.</p>

<p>To a large bowl of gold-fish twinkling lazily in the sunlight,
he invited her especial attention. They had been given
him by Clarke Shayle, he explained, to demonstrate the first
principles of swimming.</p>

<p>“Clarke’s going to make a swimmer of me,” he asserted,
“after he gets me well. Oh, you needn’t look so sorry for
me! I’ve got good arms, haven’t I? You watch the gold-fish.
They haven’t any legs.”</p>

<p>“Promise”&mdash;Dolores swallowed at the lump in her throat&mdash;“to
give me one of your medals as a souvenir some day?”</p>

<p>From a downward glance at his poor body, he stared at
her suspiciously. Evidently deciding that she was not making
sport of him, he conceded: “Of course it may be a while
yet. And we mayn’t be friends that long. That’s Clarke
coming now for my treatment. I know his step.”</p>

<p>“Dr.” Shayle lacked the professional look. Although
slightly above medium height, he was heavy as he well could
be without loss of the athletic appearance for which Dolores
had been prepared. He was young, clean-shaved, redheaded,
freckled. Next after his appearance of strength,
she noticed his cheerfulness. He had very clean teeth and
an engaging smile. Early in their interview, he laughed in a
joyous, lingering way, with a glance that coaxed her to share
his amusement. She noticed also in these first moments a
yellowish fleck in the brown iris of his right eye. It served
to give him an oddly intent expression.</p>

<p>At once after Jack’s staid ceremony of introduction, he
declared excitedly that he would not be “mauled” to-day&mdash;that
he could not be forced into a treatment.</p>

<p>“Who wants to force you?” asked Shayle. “Do you think
I enjoy wearing myself all out? A hike will be better for
you, anyhow, at the present moment. Here, let me wind up
that dog!”</p>

<p>His suggestion developed into a lesson in the slithering
walk which evidently was the afflicted lad’s chief hope of
getting along through life. The toy, over whose possession
Jack had bitten the French maid’s wrist, was a mechanical
dog whose four legs worked, when set going, with something
the movement which the osteopath was cultivating in his
patient. The dog set the pace across the room; the boy did
his best to follow.</p>

<p>“If you’d hold your head straight, little chump, not so
far to one side, you’d be better balanced,” Shayle advised
from his down-leaning, critical inspection.</p>

<p>“I won’t and I never will.” Jack stopped to glare back
at his trainer. “John always holds his head to one side and
I guess he walks all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, if John does! Like father like son&mdash;beautiful
sentiment.” At once the doctor passed the point. Giving
up seemed to be his policy. “That’s enough hiking for
to-day, old scout. Just let me feel those knee muscles. No,
not a regular boy-handling on the bed. Just a touch to see
if they aren’t working better to-day.”</p>

<p>During the operation into which Shayle had inveigled his
patient, Dolores observed that his hands, while freckled and
rather thick, were drawn into slender fingers, pointed at the
tips, with nails neatly manicured.</p>

<p>“You’ve cheated&mdash;you’re hurting me like a real treatment!”
shrieked Jack and beat his practitioner in the face
until able to wriggle out of his grasp.</p>

<p>Dr. Shayle changed the subject as promptly as he gave up
his attempt. “Have a heart, Mister Dempsey. Wait a
minute&mdash;I want to say something. What’s become of
the Cabot courtesy? You haven’t asked Miss Trent to take
off her things.”</p>

<p>“We were so busy getting acquainted!” Dolores, with a
confidential glance at the boy, lifted her hands to her hat.</p>

<p>“Allow me to make up for friend pugilist’s oversight.”
With that coaxing laugh of his, Shayle arose to help with the
Duvetyn coat.</p>

<p>In the act, his hand touched the pulse at the side of her
throat. With the contact, a strange sensation quivered
through her, disturbing, yet somehow pleasant. Evidently
he, too, had felt it. He looked straight into her eyes a
moment, his face suddenly serious.</p>

<p>“<i>Ah!</i>”</p>

<p>Oddly enough, that was all he said.</p>

<p>“Madame has a headache, Dr. Shayle. She wishes you to
attend her as soon as you have finish’ with the&mdash;with Master
Jacques.”</p>

<p>The interruption came from Annette, the maid who had
been bitten, now serene of voice and immaculate in fresh
cap and apron.</p>

<p>“What, another?”</p>

<p>Dolores heard the mutter which prefaced Shayle’s more
formal acknowledgment of the message. She was surprised
at the headache and told the doctor so. Mrs. Cabot had
looked quite well on returning from her ride.</p>

<p>Although he made no comment, she was struck by his
expression and the fact that it was reflected in the thin face
of the boy&mdash;an expression hard to define, but certainly not
sympathetic.</p>

<p>After a luncheon served for Jack and herself in his sitting-room,
the boy was retired to his nap and she summoned to
an interview with Mrs. Morrison. She was not asked
whether she would or would not stay. The housekeeper
seemed to have taken it for granted that she would. And
indeed, two realizations had settled the issue. Jack needed
her and she needed him.</p>

<p>She was shown a pleasant room farther along the third-floor
balcony and asked about her luggage. Her wages
would be the same as paid the previous governess. Mrs.
Cabot regretted a slight indisposition, but sent word that,
as Dr. Shayle approved her start with Master Jack, she was
to use her own judgment.</p>

<p>The kindly housekeeper expressed a personal hope that
she would be happy and comfortable. She must come down
to the ground-floor parlor when lonely and must not fail
to ask for anything she needed or wished.</p>

<p>Before the young heir had awakened, Dolores returned to
the outer room of the suite. She took up a magazine, but
did not feel like reading&mdash;got no farther than a page of
kennel advertisements. Her eyes upon a circle which had
been penciled around the picture of a pedigreed Airedale, she
gave up to her thoughts.</p>

<p>Strange though it was, her present situation seemed
natural. That she should find herself in the home of the
Cabots who, from among the great cityfull had figured in
both her previous engagements, impressed her as nothing
short of fatalistic. Blindfolded, she had faced in their
direction. Each of her stumbles had been a step toward
the place made ready for her. She had been prepared to
appreciate what they had to offer her; they what she could
and would return. The third attempt to earn her livelihood
surely would prove the charm. Could it be possible that
only that morning she had set out, the end of her day a
closed book? This afternoon the book lay wide, its lines
clearly typed. And pleasant reading the future chapters
looked, each day-page illumined with the joy of doing for
someone less fortunate than herself.</p>

<p>Until he spoke, she did not know that Jack was staring
at her from the bedroom doorway.</p>

<p>“You have a nicer nose than the last one. She left because
I called her ‘Needle-nose Nannie’ to her face. She
had the piercingest nose I ever saw. I never asked my
other governesses, but will you come with me on my drive?”</p>

<p>Dolores was glad to go, the more so that he had suggested
it. Already she longed that he should love her.
There seemed safety in the love of a child.</p>

<p>In the open car from which he preferred to take his air
when the weather was fine, as he told her with his manner
of a bored little man of affairs, she scarcely could restrain
the impulse to put her arm around him. Appreciating, however,
his oldishness, she contented herself with finding his
hand beneath the fur robe when a squirrel excited them by
dashing across the road in peril of their tires.</p>

<p>They did not drive for long. Sight of several children
running races on the green brought from the cripple a crisp
order of “Home, Herrick!”</p>

<p>Dolores made no protest. She understood. But she held
tight to the gloved fingers beneath the robe.</p>

<p>“I never take any chances of missing John,” was the boy’s
manufactured explanation. “He comes up to see me first
thing after he gets home.”</p>

<p>Back in his suite, the tedium of his shut-in life soon
showed in returning irritability.</p>

<p>“I do get so tired of women, women&mdash;always women! I
don’t like them any more than they like me. Why can’t they
get me a man governess?” And after a scowling moment:
“What games do you know?”</p>

<p>Dolores did not know any. “Games” had been considered
the least necessary thing in her child life. Yet the moment
was unpropitious for admitting the lack. Urgently she
applied to her imagination. A smothered cheep from the
towel-covered bird-cage brought inspiration.</p>

<p>“Did you ever try,” she asked, “a game called ‘Turn-about’?”</p>

<p>“No. How do you play it?”</p>

<p>“Another name for it is ‘Fair-Play.’ Turn-about is fair-play,
you know. First one of us&mdash;you or I&mdash;has his way.
Then, turn-about, the other has his.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like a queer game.” He considered a moment,
as the possibilities of the idea opened before him. “You
can do anything you like in your turn&mdash;all the naughty things
you’ve wanted to do and didn’t dare?”</p>

<p>“All of them&mdash;that is, all you still wish to do.”</p>

<p>“All right. First go!” A crafty look lit the gray eyes.
Turning, he shuffled across the room. “I’m going to do
what your coming stopped me from doing&mdash;break this dog.
I hate&mdash;<i>hate</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">HATE</span> it! It is just a stupid toy, but it goes
faster than I can every time and it never hurts at all.”</p>

<p>Without a word of protest, Dolores watched him hammer
the floor with the device which was at once his ambition and
his despair; allowed him to wrench it to pieces, legs from
body and head from neck.</p>

<p>“My turn now,” she said. “I’m going to take the towel
from around Dick’s cage.”</p>

<p>Sagacity was evidenced in the boy’s instant retort. “Then
I’ll take my next turn putting it back again.”</p>

<p>“And keep the game at a standstill? I can repeat, remember,
as often as you,” Dolores warned him. Stepping
down from the chair upon which she had stood to let sunlight
in upon the canary, now ruffling its yellow plumage enjoyably,
she seated herself and stayed his lifted hand. “I want
to tell you something, Jackie dear. Happiness is the most
attractive thing in the world and one of the hardest to have.
Just because your bird knows the secret of how to have
it, even though shut up in a smaller space than you, you are
jealous. So long as you’re jealous, you’ll never be happy.
I’ve never been very happy either, but I want to be and I’ve
heard that happiness begets happiness. Maybe if you and
I would listen to Dick sing, we’d get the spirit of why he
sings. Maybe after a while we could be happy, too. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“I say it’s no fun being happy.”</p>

<p>Although he jerked his hand away and spoke defiantly,
Dolores thought she saw a gleam of interest in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course, you can try if you want to,” he added. “I’ll
take my next turn spilling the gold-fish. There’ll be plenty
of time for Clarke to get me some more before I’m strong
enough to learn to swim.”</p>

<p>Heartsick, Dolores watched him stagger toward the bathroom
with the heavy glass bowl. She realized that, in steadying
himself inside, he was waiting for her to object. But
she uttered no word of reproach as he dumped the gleaming
inmates and their small sea upon the tiling. When she heard
him chuckling over their squirms, she followed him.</p>

<p>“My turn!” She took the bowl from him, filled it with
fresh water and replaced within it the emptied moss and
stones. Upon her knees on the folded bath-rug, she invited
his assistance in a way most matter-of-fact “We must get
them in quickly or they’ll die. Careful how you scoop them
up&mdash;their fins are very delicate. See how glad they are to
be back in the water again and how gracefully they swim!”</p>

<p>The boy was actually helping her when the opening of
the hall door interrupted. He steadied himself to his feet,
then slithered into the sitting-room. Still bent to her life-saving
task, Dolores heard the exchange without and saw,
over-shoulder, the man-to-man hand-shake of father and
son.</p>

<p>“Hello, John Cabot!”</p>

<p>“Jack Cabot, hello!”</p>

<p>“I broke my dog, but you know the reason, John. I’d
not mind so much if a live one beat me. Aren’t you ever
going to get me a real dog?”</p>

<p>“Your apology is accepted, Jack. But how could I know
you’d be good to a live dog if you had one? He would
have to be considered as well as you. They tell me you break
all your toys. I’d hate to see the spirit of a good dog broken.
How can I be sure&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I tell you I <i>would</i> be good to him. Don’t I keep
my word to you, John? I’d never have spilled the fishes
except that I had given in to ’Lores about Dick. Oh, you
don’t know about ’Lores yet!”</p>

<p>The boy it was who brought them again face to face.
Dolores had reëntered the living-room. John Cabot stopped
beside the center table&mdash;stopped and looked across at her.
Just what his look meant&mdash;superstition, disapproval, fear&mdash;she
could not be sure. Her heart beat uncomfortably while
she waited for him to speak.</p>

<p>“I was told down-stairs that a new governess had come,”
he said, after what seemed a long time. “I didn’t understand
that it was you.”</p>

<p>“And I didn’t understand that the position was offered by
you,” she replied. “If you are displeased, Mr. Cabot, I
will give up&mdash;Jack.”</p>

<p>“But I won’t give <i>her</i> up, John, even if she is a woman-governess.
She knows games that I never heard about. If
you’ll just get me an Airedale now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The child’s demands broke the strain of the moment.
John Cabot offered his hand. The faint smile of his reassurance
disappeared from his lips when he read on the
tiling the continuation of Jack’s story of the gold-fish.
Dolores studied him. Although a shadow lowered over his
eyes at this evidence of the evil temper of his son, he gave
her an impression of great kindness and great suppression.
He looked like what he really was&mdash;which, she had noticed,
most men do not.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, my boy, that I could not trust a live dog
to you,” he said.</p>

<p>He was restoring the last of the stranded aquatics to comfort
within the bowl when a lilting laugh surprised the three.
Mrs. Cabot, evidently recovered from her headache, was
watching them.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h3>
</div>

<p>John Cabot seldom spoke with the new governess, as she
took to absenting herself during the afternoon hour which
he spent with his son. None the less she learned much about
him and, through the opinion of others, came to hold him in
high regard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morrison, daughter of the distinguished-looking old
butler, Bradish, had been with the Cabot family practically
her lifetime and proved an enthusiastic informant at the
tea-time chats to which she frequently invited the girl. She
took a personal pride in her employer and his career.</p>

<p>Mr. Cabot, she boasted, was one of the few “real” New
Yorkers. His family had lived in Manhattan since the sixteen-fifties.
A red brick house in Whitehall Street, near
the Battery, had been the birthplace of two generations of
his grandfathers. There the Cabots had lived in the days
when Castle Garden was the home of Grand Opera and
Jennie Lind its Galli-Curci. The old house still stood,
although its quondam drawing-room, where once the fair
and gallant had stepped the minuet, now staged nothing
more romantic than haggles over the price of shipping stores.</p>

<p>The comfortable fortune awaiting the present head of
the house on his graduation from Princeton, he had increased
to great wealth through an international banking
organization built up largely through his efforts. Particularly
proud was the housekeeper over the fact that not only
the Cabot dollars but the master himself had worked
unceasingly to “win the war,” that not only his own Government,
but also those of Britain and France had heaped
honors upon him. In the underwriting of the war loans of
the Allies and in the direction of American Liberty Bond
flotations the services he had rendered without financial gain
were declared inestimable. For a time, indeed, the Cabot
Bank&mdash;a classic structure on Broad Street within a stone’s
throw of the homestead&mdash;had been the acknowledged center
of war finance for half the world.</p>

<p>By his employees&mdash;also according to Morrison&mdash;the
banker was adored for his democratic manner; was respected
for the unfailing honesty of his business code; was, at the
same time, served with the diligence of fear. In his home,
his every gesture was anticipated that it might be the more
quickly obeyed. None, not even the beautiful madame,
would have dared question any of the direct wishes he so
seldom expressed.</p>

<p>To his only son John Cabot was a fascinating mystery.</p>

<p>“You know, John’s a queer man,” the boy confided to
Dolores, with his elderly faculty for analysis. “He’s as
quiet and kind as anybody could be and yet he keeps everyone
scared of him. Morrison says it’s because he is ‘just.’ What
is there about justice, ’Lores, that everybody’s so scared of?”</p>

<p>On another occasion: “One thing I like about John, is
the interest he can take in little things. Why, he plays my
Christmas games better than I do, and the way he can keep
clocks going! Sometimes when he stays home evenings, he
brings almost a dozen in here and sits on the floor and gets
them all ticking at once. That clock of my great-grandfather
Cabot’s is his pet. All the jewelers said the old works would
have to be replaced. But John says he’s going to keep it
going through my lifetime at least. He’s funny that way.
He never thinks of dying. Somehow, I don’t think anybody
could make him die until he got ready.”</p>

<p>Once the child-man had opened up a hurt in his confidence:
“I heard my mother tell John one day that my
grandmother&mdash;his own mother, you know&mdash;might have called
him ‘Jack,’ but she felt sure that nobody else had. She said
he was the uncompromising kind of man that everybody just
naturally called ‘John.’ Sometimes my mother talks as if
she did not think much of John, any more than she does of
me. That’s why I can’t think much of her. Just what kind
is an uncompromising man, ’Lores?”</p>

<p>Even by madame herself were the peculiarities of the master
of the great house discussed with the latest comer.
Dolores, yielding to the unexpected fancy which Catherine
seemed to have taken to her and looking on her with almost
worshipful eyes in her sacred capacity of motherhood, welcomed
every opportunity of showing her gratitude. One
stormy afternoon, when she had been summoned to m’lady’s
quarters on the second floor, the trend of the wife’s conversation
became an urge that the governess think well of her
husband.</p>

<p>Fragrant from her bath, Catherine was sitting before a
pier glass in her dressing room leisurely and, it would seem
regretfully, covering her exquisite body with undergarments
of rather sleazy texture. The fresh-opened box of bon-bons
which stood on a nearby tabourette she urged upon Dolores
with her comments.</p>

<p>“John Cabot’s character is an open book&mdash;<i>in cipher</i>,” she
declared. “I have noticed, my dear, that you appear to be
just a bit in awe of him. It seems too bad when you will
be thrown so much together over Jack. Perhaps if I give
you the key to him you will feel more comfortable in his
presence. He is not nearly so cold or stern as he acts.
Really, he used to be quite ardent before&mdash;&mdash; Well, you
know, before we got to know each other so thoroughly. I
used to think him the strongest man I’d ever met.”</p>

<p>Dolores resented the insinuation. “But isn’t he still
stronger, now that he has learned to control his feelings?
And perhaps he wouldn’t wish people to be given what you
call the key to him.”</p>

<p>But Catherine was not listening, as told by the opera air
she hummed. She had become intent over an open drawerful
of lingerie, some pieces simple, some elaborate as the
sweat-shop set bought that day at Seff’s. With the selection
of a rather plain Philippine linen for that day’s wear, her
interest returned to the ever engrossing subject of herself.</p>

<p>“Queer, isn’t it, how one’s early habits will cling? Have
you heard that I wasn’t always rich? I haven’t a dollar
except what Mr. Cabot has settled on me. My father had
plenty to start with, but he squandered it all on ‘old masters’
that turned out to be neither masters nor old. I try to
forget the humiliations of those days, but every now and
then am reminded by little things&mdash;like, for instance, this.”</p>

<p>At the puzzled look with which Dolores’ eyes met the
emergence of her own from the neck scallops of the sheer
envelope, she expanded:</p>

<p>“I never wear my best clothes on a stormy day. Isn’t that
too funny, when I don’t need to think of the weather? I’m
interested in noting my own characteristics quite as much as
I would be those of another person. Dr. Shayle says that
I have the introspective faculty to a marked degree. I
appreciate the compliment from him.”</p>

<p>“He seems to see,” the girl remarked, “so much more than
is on the surface.”</p>

<p>By way of the glass, Catherine smiled at her, the short
upper lip which was a piquant flaw in otherwise perfect
features lifting over her gleaming, mouselike teeth.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dr. Shayle has remarkable powers! I discovered
him, you know. No wonder he admires me and feels&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>For once Dolores interrupted. She did not wish to be told
first-hand of the likable young osteopath’s devotion, concerning
which she had heard considerable gossip from the
servants. She felt that it would not be just loyal to Dr.
Shayle. Although fearful for her temerity, she changed the
subject.</p>

<p>“That day you engaged me, the Marquis d’Elie spoke of
other needs of your household in which I might help. You
have been very kind to me and I want to do all I can in
return. Won’t you tell me what they are&mdash;the other needs?”</p>

<p>Relieved that her beautiful employer showed no resentment,
she did not try to analyze the confused look turned
into the mirror.</p>

<p>“The need the marquis meant&mdash;&mdash;” Catherine spoke
readily enough after the moment’s pause&mdash;“is mine for
someone congenial to talk with in this great barn of a house&mdash;someone
refined, you know, with a mind more the quality
of my own. That’s all, really, just someone to lift the heavy
moments. D’Elie feels a deep sympathy for me.”</p>

<p>So pathetic did she sound and look that Dolores, too, felt
sympathetic. That the enviable Mrs. Cabot might have a
secret sorrow had not occurred to her. This time she did
not check the tendency toward confidence; waited rather
in silence, lest she seem inquisitive, for whatsoever might be
entrusted to her. But before Catherine could continue, someone
entered the boudoir that opened off the dressing room.
It was the Marquis d’Elie.</p>

<p>That was the early afternoon when he, like the oft-mentioned
“angel” of the old saw, startled them both by an
unannounced appearance. Dolores was sitting out of his
line of vision, but she could see him plainly in the pier
glass. She rose, outraged at the Frenchman’s presumption
with the wife of John Cabot; turned toward Catherine;
waited for her to reprimand him as he deserved.</p>

<p>Catherine, who had been in the act of tying a ribbon at
her breast, stiffened as if turned to the marble she looked
and stared into the glass at the reflection of the smiling
alien. A hurried glance she spared for the confections of silk
crepe and lace in the open drawer, then bit her lip. When
at last she spoke, her voice was one of utter exasperation.</p>

<p>“And me in a cotton chemise!”</p>

<p>“But lovely&mdash;ah&mdash;as a lily of <i>la belle France</i>!” the
Marquis enthused. “I have slip’ up for that small talk of
confidence about the amount of the dot, <i>mon ange</i>. I feel
distress that you must sue for so much. But the responsibility
is on me to assure that my queen have those comfort
to which&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You certainly slipped up!” Sharply Catherine cut into
the expression of his “responsibility.” Hers seemed to be
for Dolores and the dressing robe which she had worn from
her bath. This she donned before going into the boudoir.
“You shouldn’t have come unannounced, Henri. Never do
such a thing again. How fortunate it is that Miss Trent
happened to be with me. You remember meeting Jack’s new
governess?”</p>

<p>His assurance was remarkable. Low he bowed before
Dolores when, in response to Catherine’s appeal, she followed.</p>

<p>“And how is mademoiselle enabled to do with the fiend-<i>enfant</i>?”
he enquired affably.</p>

<p>Dolores strove to control her contempt for him. She
replied that she found Jack no fiend, but a most lovable
child. He must be awakening from his nap about now.
Would Mrs. Cabot excuse her?</p>

<p>“First, my dear, won’t you ring for Annette?” Catherine
made proviso.</p>

<p>“And how,” the marquis persisted in the wait, “is the so-famed
siren enabled to do with Meester Cabot?”</p>

<p>Grateful for the support of madame’s frown, Dolores
answered, steadily as she might: “So far Mr. Cabot has
made no complaint of my methods with his son.”</p>

<p>“She has done wonderfully&mdash;<i>with Jack</i>.” Catherine
smiled at Dolores her innocent smile. “I, for one, am most
grateful to Miss Trent, even if John hasn’t shown his appreciation.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has not&mdash;<i>as yet</i>&mdash;have the opportunity.” The
foreigner, too, contributed an encouraging beam.</p>

<p>“Just what I’ve been telling her!” Catherine approved.
“Miss Trent is so very self-effacing that I fear John
thinks&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Just which of the wife’s fancies was about to be attributed
to the great brain of John Cabot, Dolores never knew. She
felt a sudden and vehement disinclination to hear his possible
thoughts discussed before such an audience. She crossed
to the gallery door.</p>

<p>“I hear Annette coming. I&mdash;I’d like to go, Mrs. Cabot.
Jack may be looking for me.”</p>

<p>She did not wait for the elevator, but hurried up the wide
marble steps that led from gallery to gallery to the top of
the house. Fast as she took them, however, distressing
questions pursued her.</p>

<p>What was she to think&mdash;how conduct herself?</p>

<p>Looking into Jack’s living-room, she saw that the door
into his bedroom still was closed. The calm-faced clock
announced that it was not really time for him to have
awakened. As she went toward her own chamber to wait,
she heard the click of the elevator letting someone off at the
third gallery, but did not glance up to see who it was. She
wished to be alone&mdash;to think.</p>

<p>Once her own door was closed, however, she shrank from
thinking. Rather than force herself to any immediate conclusion
regarding the surprising developments of the last
several minutes, she allowed her mind to rest, as it were,
upon the thought of young Jack.</p>

<p>During the days which had accumulated into weeks since
her entry into the Cabot home, her influence upon the boy
had continued to be poured into the mold of their first hour.
The household agreed that none of the many who had undertaken
him had approached her success. Rather than the
problem which he was said to have been to earlier governesses,
he had become a revelation to her.</p>

<p>Although they continued to play “Turn-About” at times,
she had ceased to rely upon games for the establishment of
understanding between them. So long as Jack did what he
knew to be right and fair, he and she might share enjoyment,
even happiness. When he ceased, her disappointment in him
spoiled their day. They consulted upon every item of their
daily program subject to change. From play to text-books
had been a gradual but sure transition. What at first had
caused ruction, became a medium of pleasant companionship.
Lessons learned under a “pal” instead of a task-mistress
didn’t seem like lessons at all.</p>

<p>Dolores’ service was but what she would have given unrequited
to the stunted human plant. Love had bloomed as
her reward. The lad’s devotion to her had become a by-word
in the house.</p>

<p>Only last evening, when she had slipped into his room
to tell him good-night after the maid had left, he had overcome
his prejudice against any show of affection sufficiently
to lift his over-long arms about her neck.</p>

<p>“’Lores,” he had whispered half-ashamedly, “I have made
up a nice name for you. I don’t wish to tell even you what
it is. I’m afraid you’d make fun of it. It is just a little
name for you that I save to think about when I’m trying to
go to sleep.”</p>

<p>With the poignant memory, the girl felt comforted. Life,
which hitherto had seemed indifferent when not actually
cruel toward her, had grown kind. Surely no malice of Jade
Fate could be behind the gift of a child’s adoration.</p>

<p>And in what luxury did she live&mdash;she, whose sole capital
so recently had been a ripening nectarine! No opportunity
was given her to think of her needs. They were fore-attended.
Beside her own beautiful room, the young heir’s
kingdom was shared with her. And more than her needs
were remembered. Mrs. Cabot’s gratitude and affection took
the practical form of tickets to theater and opera matinees,
of the free use of Jack’s car, and twice of invitations downstairs
to dine <i>en famille</i>. In a partial expenditure of her
salary, she had acquired, by way of being more worthy her
surroundings, some unpretentious, but pretty clothes. The
black worn for Trevor Trent she had laid away for the gayer
colors liked by Jack, just as she was trying to lay away
sorrow for good cheer.</p>

<p>To-day, where was that good cheer?</p>

<p>Here she had shut herself in her room in a panic of foreboding.
Was she so used to trouble that she would attract
by expecting it? Despite the general kindness toward her,
she felt afraid.</p>

<p>There was Dr. Clarke Shayle. At first his show of interest
in her had been confined to the period of Jack’s daily
treatment, when he would chat with the two of them in the
set phrases to which he was given, leaving an impression of
impartial friendliness. But a few days before he had
returned during the boy’s nap hour to add a detail to his
instructions. Even Jack had pierced the pretense and taken
occasion, through some instinct or reason over which he
grew quite sullen, to acquaint his mother with the fact.</p>

<p>The annoyance shown by Mrs. Cabot brought memory
back to the more recent annoyance of this early afternoon.
What had given the Marquis d’Elie the right of way to
madame’s boudoir? She decided to force the question from
her mind as beyond her scope. General hints about the
impecunious foreigner had been emphasized by Annette
after the style of the French paper-backs which formed her
ideas of high-life lived low. Vicariously the maid had
thrilled over d’Elie’s infatuation for her beautiful mistress;
deplored the fact that m’lady, being, alas, already wedded,
might not acquire the right to the proud title of Marquise
of France; grieved over the misfortune that her heroine,
having no personal fortune, might not with financial safety
free herself. Oh, not that madame had any more real feeling
for her suitor than for her own husband! Her heart’s
love, as Annette had reason to know, was given to another.
That complication, however, was according to form, as
written in French originals.</p>

<p>All this was peace-poison, Dolores decided, and for such
there was no antidote. One thing only must she remember.
“M’lady” was John Cabot’s wife. The fact stared from her
dressing-table mirror each time, as now, she smoothed her
hair and compared its blackness with Catherine’s glory of
fine silk and pale gold. Of it she was reminded each time
her heart expanded over lonely Jack or her eyes caught the
gleam of the limp diamond-and-platinum circlet which was
his mother’s latest acquired and much admired “wedding”
ring.</p>

<p>She herself had been judged unjustly by appearances. She
must not&mdash;she would not judge. Married women, she had
been told, outgrew the prudishness which mothers taught
their daughters. And titled foreigners were said to be more
careless of conventions than the great, clean men of America.
Every melioration she must consider. Perhaps even the
much-discussed pair’s recent suggestions to her, at which
she had felt such offense, had been conceived as they were
worded, in kindness. Catherine was the wife of the king
of the Cabots and the mother of Prince Jack. The queen-mother
could do no wrong.</p>

<p>Her decision reached, Dolores realized an unwonted
physical fatigue. She lay down on the bed for a moment
that she might take a fresh face and mind to Jack. A glance
at the ivory clock on her bedside table told her that it was
fifteen minutes to three. She closed her eyes with the intention
of allowing herself the quarter hour. For several
minutes she continued in full consciousness of the trustful
thoughts upon which she had decided as a policy. Then
soon, although daytime napping was not her habit, she fell
into a doze.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed open before she was fairly awake, as if
at a call. For a moment she gave up to an exquisite sensation
which had come to her. She felt relaxed, flushed, very
much at peace. In a sort of dream, someone with strong
arms who cared for her had rocked her as she often had
longed to rock Jack. Repeatedly a tender, infusing voice
had said to her: “Rest, little girl.... Everything’s all
right.... Rest.... Rest.”</p>

<p>And she had rested. How long? A glance at the clock
brought her to her feet. It was fifteen minutes after three!</p>

<p>Near the head of the stairway, beneath a boxed catalpa
tree, stood a decorative carved stone seat. Upon it sat Dr.
Clarke Shayle. As, with a nod, Dolores was about to hurry
past him and into Jack’s room, he caught her hand and drew
her to a seat beside him.</p>

<p>“You can spare a moment for the human headache
powder,” he said. “Tell me, how did you like it?”</p>

<p>“<i>It?</i>” She stared at him.</p>

<p>“The powder. But never mind. You don’t need to
answer. You certainly look some better at the present moment
than when you ran away from me into your room.”</p>

<p>“You can’t mean that&mdash;that you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The yellowish fleck in his eye twinkled, although his face
was unusually serious as he glanced down at the watch
which, oddly enough, lay face up in his palm.</p>

<p>“At eight minutes of three I volunteered a first-aid treatment.
I coddled you mentally the way I’d like to do really.
You are an easy subject, you poor, scared little chump. But
it’s a hard life waiting on a stone bench. At fifteen after
three I was selfish enough to give you the wake-up ring.
Come, how <i>did</i> you like it?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I do feel refreshed. What is it about you&mdash;what is
it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve wanted to explain that and a lot of things to you
for days, but you’ll never give me an opportunity. I want
to explain myself to you before someone does it for me&mdash;to
tell you to look out for me. I am what you might consider
a ‘dangerous’ man. Oh, it’s not inherited&mdash;it’s a gift.”</p>

<p>This rueful repetition of one of the several set phrases
with which he punctuated his most serious utterances was
accompanied by the quick, cheerful laugh which was his
greatest charm. Then the laugh’s smile stiffened into an
expression of utter misery.</p>

<p>So shocked was Dolores that she forgot her hurry to go.</p>

<p>He turned from the sight of her sympathy; forced himself
to continue. “I am not an honest osteopath, Miss Trent.
My success is founded on the fact that I am magnetic.
You felt that the first day you met me. You remember?
See how strangely I can make you feel with a touch.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember. Oh, don’t&mdash;please don’t do that
again!”</p>

<p>Even in freeing her wrist from the slim pulsant fingers
which had clasped it, she realized that her sensations justified
his boast. Fearing his touch, she liked it.</p>

<p>“Never mind, I won’t. I don’t want to attract you that
way. You can trust me. I won’t touch you again&mdash;that is,
not until you wish me to. Try to get what I’m telling you.
It may kill me with you, but there’s no other way than to
make a clean breast of it. I’ve built up my practice on nothing
more or less than animal magnetism. Excites through
the touch system. Gives sensations instead of curing them.
Lord help me, she doesn’t see when I tell her how low I am!”</p>

<p>He paused as if in hope of help from her. But Dolores
could not speak. She was trying to believe that she had
misunderstood.</p>

<p>“Lately I find that I’m getting psychic control,” he continued.
“A nice little lot of harm I could do in the world
if I wanted to.” His voice was husky. In the moment
before he dropped his face into his hands his clean smile
showed again. “But I don’t want to. I hate this life. I
hate my success. I hate being called in the profession ‘The
Ladies’ Pet.’ Did you know I was called ‘The Ladies’
Pet’?”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Dolores, “that Mrs. Cabot thinks you are
a remarkable man.”</p>

<p>“<i>She</i> should. She made me what I am to-day and to-morrow&mdash;handed
me over to her social set. She’s satisfied,
if I’m not. She knows and I know that she can unmake
me just as easily.”</p>

<p>“Why should she unmake you? She seems to take a
pride in you and in your admiration for her.”</p>

<p>“My <i>what</i>?”</p>

<p>“Only this afternoon, Dr. Shayle, she was telling me what
you had said about her powers of introspection and concentration.”</p>

<p>“Her powers of&mdash;&mdash; You little chump!” He glanced
toward the stairway; controlled his incipient laugh; added
guardedly: “She hasn’t enough concentration to write a
postal card.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you flatter her so?”</p>

<p>“Ladies’ pets are trained to meet the demands for flattery
of their petters. Catherine has a certain surface shrewdness,
yes. But you can’t ‘reach’ her. Don’t worry about her.
Worry about me, Dolores. Tut, don’t scold me! You
wouldn’t if you knew how long I’ve wanted to call you
Dolores to your face. I am doing what is awfully hard for
me, not to have you point out my weaknesses, but in the hope
that you’ll encourage me to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>With a smothered imprecation, he stopped. From his
slumped position he had seen before Dolores that Mrs. Cabot
was ascending the stairs. At the top of the climb she
stopped and saw them. She was dressed in a negligee of
yellow satin and lace and looked exceedingly angry.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard voices and wondered if this could be
possible.” Her upper lip whitened over the mouse teeth as
she directly addressed Dr. Shayle. “Don’t you know that I
am waiting for my treatment?”</p>

<p>The color of the young man’s hair blended into his forehead
and cheeks. He got to his feet.</p>

<p>“Miss Trent and I have had quite a talk.” Although obviously
nervous, he forced his coaxing smile. “We’ve discussed
most of the important questions of the day. Not
that we’ve got anything settled at the present moment. But
we’ve exercised our minds and so have made progress, even
if the world&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If you <i>only</i> wouldn’t say ‘at the present moment’!” Catherine
snapped.</p>

<p>With not a second glance at the governess, but a peremptory
gesture to her physician, she turned back to the
stairs.</p>

<p>Shayle, his athletic shoulders squaring, followed her.</p>

<p>“You needn’t take it out on me because I’m not a clever
talker,” Dolores heard him say to Catherine as, his hand
at her elbow, he assisted her in the descent “My stupidity
ain’t inherited. It’s a gift.”</p>

<p>At a sound Dolores turned to see Jack looking on from
his door. His eyes were wide and grave&mdash;in expression
much like his father’s. His head slanted exactly as the
elder John held his. With his laboriously acquired, makeshift
walk, he crossed the balcony to a stop before her.</p>

<p>“Something said to me&mdash;&mdash;” he began; paused to think;
continued: “I guess I mean that myself said to myself I’d
best come out and ’tend to you. Maybe I’m foolish to worry
about you,’Lores, and yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And yet,” she supplied, serious as he, “maybe you’re not.
Look after me, Jack. I need you to, for you are my safest
friend.”</p>

<p>She took comfort in his elderly assurances; tried to throw
off the prescience that weighed on her at thought of Catherine’s
outraged look. But she was afraid.</p>

<p>Look high, look low, she was afraid.</p>

</div>

<p>As proved by developments of the next day, Dolores need
not have feared that Mrs. Cabot would blame her for the
interest of the uniquely attractive young osteopath. Evidently
she was of too sweet a nature for that. During the
after-luncheon respite, when the girl sat reading in her room
to avoid a possible repetition of yesterday’s telepathic
tête-à-tête, madame sought her in an exceptionally gracious
mood. She was followed by her maid, who bore a long
black-and-white striped box.</p>

<p>“Lay it on the bed, Annette.”</p>

<p>Having dismissed the reluctant Frenchwoman, she turned
to Dolores with a manner of affectionate anticipation.</p>

<p>“I saw it yesterday at Yungman’s <i>revue</i>,” she announced.
“As it stayed on my imagination over night, I sent Annette
this morning to buy it.”</p>

<p>“It?” Dolores tried to feel on faith something of Mrs.
Cabot’s pleasurable excitement.</p>

<p>“It’s from <i>Angèle</i>, the colors copied from an overcast sunset,
mostly gray, with just a suggestion through the mists of
lavender and rose. And it’s built of the clingingest stuff.
I <i>hope</i> you’ll like it.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I shall. All your things are beautiful.”</p>

<p>Dolores hovered over the tissue wrappings with the true
girl’s interest.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed in a voice soft as the fabric.</p>

<p>“Oh!”&mdash;again, as Catherine lifted an evening gown on its
satin-padded hanger and suspended it from the electrolier.
The most stupid cynic could not have doubted the governess’
worshipful gaze, and madame, while in many respects
a cynic, was far from stupid.</p>

<p>“The lines of the manikin who wore it,” Catherine added,
“didn’t compare with yours.”</p>

<p>And what had her “lines” to do with such a gown?
Dolores looked the question.</p>

<p>“You are built for <i>décolleté</i>, my dear. The Marquis
d’Elie remarked it only yesterday, after you’d sailed so
gracefully from my rooms. Oh, you needn’t scorn a compliment
from him! He’s a bit shy on discretion according
to American standards, but he has studied women as a fine
art. What he said about your possibilities made me remember
this model. Of course I shouldn’t have considered it
for myself.”</p>

<p>“The dress, Mrs. Cabot, is for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“For you, silly. You can see at a glance that my coloring
kills it.” Catherine reassured herself of the fact in the
mirror. “With your duo-tones&mdash;ebony hair and alabaster
hide&mdash;&mdash; The dress is a little token of appreciation from
Papa-John and Mamma-me over your success with our son.
It is just a fine <i>Angèle</i> feather for our household angel.”</p>

<p>“<i>Dear</i> Mrs. Cabot!”</p>

<p>Dolores’ exclamation was the more emotional for the
doubts which she had felt over her benefactress’ sincerity
toward herself. Lest she reveal by word or look the self-recriminations
that filled her mind, she returned to the gift;
touched its lax, silken folds; pressed to one cheek a wisp
of its subtly tinted tulle.</p>

<p>“My first evening dress,” she murmured with a fervor
which showed that admiration was fast deepening into possessive
love. “Even though I haven’t any present need of
it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you have. You’ll need it to-night.” Catherine spoke
positively. “Mr. Cabot has telephoned Bradish that an old
friend of the family is to dine with us and I want you to
make a fourth at table. Rufus Holt is a university pal of
John’s and said to be the ablest divorce lawyer in New
York. He never loses a case, perhaps because he can’t be
bribed to take the side of the person in the wrong. What’s
more, my dear, he’s a bachelor.”</p>

<p>“I’d enjoy meeting him, I’m sure, and you’re very kind to
ask me down, but you see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.” Catherine subtracted the half of her attention
from the mirror and gave the whole to Dolores. “I
don’t see&mdash;and won’t&mdash;any reason in the world why you
shouldn’t be more a member of this family. We are all very
fond of you and we know that you are superior to the
position you occupy. Life has been against you, that’s all.
But I am for you. Haven’t you realized that fact yet?”</p>

<p>“I do appreciate your kindness&mdash;all the kindness which
has been shown me in your house, Mrs. Cabot.”</p>

<p>“Then show your appreciation my way. Don’t spoil my
pleasure by looking suspiciously on every decent deed I try
to do. You act, positively, as if you thought I was jealous
of your looks. Why, you make a wonderful foil for me!
Several have spoken of it. Even Dr. Shayle who, being redheaded
himself, has a natural preference for brunettes,
agreed with me yesterday that you and I are as different
as two women could be. Do you know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Catherine hesitated, as if from modesty. When she continued
it was with that air of saying something especially
thoughtful and original with which she now and then substantiated
her claim to “brains.”</p>

<p>“Of course everybody has some favorite type of feminine
beauty. This man admires a woman in whom his best friend
can’t see any charm. A third appreciates another whose good
looks neither of the first two will admit. And so on. But
about myself&mdash;&mdash; It is a strange thing that when I was a
young girl, every artist who came to my father’s house to
examine those alleged ‘old masters’ I was telling you about
used to beg to paint me. I remember one of them explaining
it by the theory that a golden blond is humanized sunshine&mdash;and
that sunshine is something craved by everyone. Perhaps
it sounds vain for me to repeat, but they were agreed
that my type was the only one universally admired.”</p>

<p>Far from thinking her vain, Dolores almost envied her the
pleasure she could take in her own looks. People generally
spoke of “the beautiful Mrs. Cabot,” perhaps for just that
reason&mdash;that people generally enjoyed sunshine.</p>

<p>“And now that I am trying to shed some few beams your
way, you spoil the spirit of the thing right at the start. You
might think of others than yourself.”</p>

<p>That the reproach had effect on Dolores showed in the
startled question of the purple-black eyes. Catherine proceeded
to reply:</p>

<p>“We’re not so happy in this shell of a home but that we
might be happier. I am not speaking of myself so much as&mdash;as
my husband. He needs cheering up and I, somehow,
have lost the power to cheer him. I’ve thought that perhaps
you could help. Despite his taciturnity, he likes you for
what you have done for Jack. If you wouldn’t be so shy
with him, would just talk to him naturally, study him and
try to please him, you know, you would be accomplishing&mdash;well,
more than you possibly can realize. I’d be in your
debt, not you in mine. You’ve never received anything approaching
an order since you came to us, have you? And,
Heaven knows, I don’t wish you to consider anything I suggest
in that light. Only I <i>should</i> like you to join us at dinner
to-night.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rufus Holt was dapper in stature, but of an expansive
personality. Although crinkled around the eyes and slightly
bald, he had the spontaneity of eternal youth. From first
glance, he directed toward Dolores a sort of friendly homage.</p>

<p>“I like the way you acknowledge an introduction,” he confided
during their first five minutes. “The exaggerated
delight with which most everybody takes most everybody
else for granted is absurd, isn’t it? Without a word, Miss
Trent, you’ve done a rather remarkable thing&mdash;given a
lawyer a brand-new thought.”</p>

<p>Dolores was pleased that he so quickly found something
about her to like. She expanded under his persiflage.</p>

<p>“I never learned ‘manners’ in any school,” she deprecated,
“but I’ve tried to teach myself by behaving like the people I
admire.”</p>

<p>“Well, give up! I don’t think you could act the least bit
like anybody else if you tried, any more than&mdash;&mdash;” The
mirth lines around Holt’s eyes uncrinkled as, silently, he
appreciated her in the mist-gray gown. “A dove just
couldn’t waddle like a goose,” he finished. “Don’t let anybody
change your first bow. It is perfect&mdash;no undue cordiality
about it, any more than undue <i>hauteur</i>. You do it
gravely, simply, hopefully. Just now you gave me one quick,
enquiring glance to see whether you were glad to meet me,
before you committed yourself by saying so. I’ll take a
bet you don’t know my name.”</p>

<p>Dolores looked embarrassed. “That wouldn’t be a fair
bet. You see, Mrs. Cabot told me beforehand.”</p>

<p>“Honest, too! What are your faults?” He laughed.</p>

<p>Catherine returned to them from an aside with Bradish.
If the governess looked a mauve-and-rose-breasted dove to
the facile-tongued attorney, madame was a bird of Paradise
in her topaz velvet and high-massed, glinting, silver-gold
hair. And her evening manner matched the brilliancy of her
attire.</p>

<p>“Latest reports from the front are that John will be down&mdash;well,
when John is down,” she announced. “Things never
happen in this house, even food, until John is down.”</p>

<p>“It is gossip on the Street that some bricks of his Wall
have caved in,” Holt offered. “He never in his life kept
a woman waiting unless obliged to. You see, Miss Trent,
we men who know John Cabot like to brag about him. We
consider him the best example extant of the fairness of
the unfair sex.”</p>

<p>“Oh, John’s a hero, no doubt of that!” Catherine’s out-flung
glittering hands illustrated her somewhat contemptuous
attitude toward most things which others approved, her husband
included. “Heroes are all right when one is young and
unsophisticated, but they do seem stereotyped to a grown-up.
Don’t you think so? You always know exactly what
they are going to do. The villains, now, are more interesting.
There’s some excitement in learning the worst about
them&mdash;always a chance for something unexpected. They
may even reform. <i>You</i> ought to agree with me, Rufus.”</p>

<p>“I might,” Holt returned, “but for certain suspicions as
to which class you are consigning me. In all my comradeship
with John I never felt sure of anything connected with
what he was going to do except that it would be the square
thing when done.”</p>

<p>The small controversy was closed by the appearance of its
subject. As he stood looking in on them from the doorway&mdash;the
master of the house&mdash;he was photographed on Dolores’
memory. Clean-cut against the vista of the dim-lit foyer in
his evening black and white, his hands depending stiffly, his
head side-set, he suggested controlled power.</p>

<p>From his first surprised glance at herself, she appreciated
that he had been unprepared for the presence of the governess.
But his wife’s expectant eyes also were upon her.</p>

<p>Licensed by the fact that she had not seen him in a couple
of days, Dolores offered him her hand in greeting and
looked up into his face when he stooped to touch for the
briefest of moments her finger-tips. Yesterday she would
have veiled her admiration. To-night she had a prescribed
part to play. She could not help regretting the overture,
however, when she saw his smile recede; realized that he
had turned, without a word, away from her. A pressure
hurt her throat. But she cheered at Catherine’s encouraging
nod. Remembering those in-caving bricks of his down-town
“Wall,” she forgave the forbidding attitude of one said to
be so just.</p>

<p>When dinner was announced, she obeyed Catherine’s
signal that she take the arm of the host. On their stroll
through the great hall toward the dining-room, she found
occasion to thank him for the latest Cabot gift.</p>

<p>“The dress&mdash;that I gave you?” His tone was mildly exclamatory.</p>

<p>“You and Mrs. Cabot.”</p>

<p>“So I gave you that dress?” he asked more easily. “Of
course we <i>are</i> getting on toward Christmas. Then I am
prepared for little surprises like this&mdash;have to go around, you
know, asking everybody what I gave them. I wonder <i>why</i>&mdash;the
dress?”</p>

<p>She tried not to show how disconcerted she felt. “Mrs.
Cabot said it was because I get along so well with Jack,
although that’s nothing to reward me so beautifully for.
Getting on with Jack is its own reward.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” he murmured, as though his memory had
been jogged. “To be sure,” he repeated, his eyes upon the
velvet V of his wife’s back.</p>

<p>“No matter why you made the gift, Mr. Cabot, it is an
event in my life. To-night is the first time I’ve ever been
in evening dress.”</p>

<p>At last he looked down at her and interestedly.</p>

<p>Dolores felt both pleased and abashed. Never, she realized,
had she worn anything so becoming as this gown. Its
delicate gray increased, rather than shamed the pallor and
texture of her skin. Its rose seemed dimly to reflect the
red of her lips, its mauve the deep purple of her eyes. Her
hair, done low on her neck to hide as much as possible of
the gleaming flesh which had not before been exposed to the
eyes of man, made an oval, ebony frame for her face.</p>

<p>“Never having been a girl myself, I don’t suppose I realize
just what the first one means: Really, I didn’t suppose I
had such good taste.” With which ambiguous comment he
withdrew both eyes and interest. Evidently the subject of
herself was dismissed.</p>

<p>Despite the lessons of her past, Dolores felt disappointed.
The Rev. Alexander Willard had looked at her often and
long. Seff had looked at her and looked again. As she
went about the city, strangers filled her with uneasiness by
their stares. She supposed she should be glad that one
man was superior to the attraction of looks which she had
been forced to conclude were unusual. She should be glad,
yes. And yet, she caught herself wishing that this man, on
this occasion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Through that never-to-be-forgotten dinner&mdash;the first
formal one of her life&mdash;she made effort to adapt herself as
a unit of the quartette and to attend Mrs. Cabot’s converse
with something the responsiveness of Rufus Holt. Her
awe of Bradish and the second butler she conquered enough
to sample the dishes passed. She became sufficiently accustomed
to the candle-light to appreciate this and that detail&mdash;the
drawn-work dinner cloth, the Sheffield service, the
gleam of a fountain playing Nature’s music in the conservatory
beyond. She commented on the match of the fulvid,
velvety orchids that formed the centerpiece with their
hostess’ gown. With the rest she sipped of a vintage
recommended by their host as from the fore-stocked Cabot
cellar.</p>

<p>“You’ll go far these dry days and drink&mdash;well, perhaps too
much, to find better Burgundy than this,” he said. “It is
neither too thick nor too thin; neither sweet nor sour;
smooth and gentle, yet not heady. And the color&mdash;&mdash;
Hasn’t it the rich red of dreams come true?”</p>

<p>“Speaking of color, John,” the attorney suggested, “are
you noticing the rare contrast between two ladies fair
to-night?”</p>

<p>John Cabot nodded and glanced abstractedly into his wife’s
pleased, expectant face, but omitted altogether to look the
governess’ way.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, I’m single. <i>I</i> can enjoy such things.”
Holt laughed.</p>

<p>“You mean,” John corrected, “you can enjoy them out
loud.”</p>

<p>“And why can’t you, John?” Catherine protested. “Naturally
and connubially, you find it rather dull paying compliments
to me, but certainly Miss Trent deserves a few. Why
in the world don’t you warm up?”</p>

<p>“I am warming up,” he replied, his dry smile all for
the wet wine in his glass.</p>

<p>She showed increased dissatisfaction over his impersonalities.
“You sound and look distrait to-night. Are you
worried, dear? Rufus told us something about bricks falling
on the Street. Is it true that you were hit?”</p>

<p>“Hard hit.”</p>

<p>“You mean that you lost money?”</p>

<p>“Lost?” He spoke with vague surprise. “Can I ever
lose? Alas, no. While the rumor-mongers were spreading
the report which Rufus heard about my losses, I made&mdash;made&mdash;<i>made</i>.”</p>

<p>“You funny, clever John! Tell me”&mdash;a gleam lit the
wife’s eyes&mdash;“was it much that you made?”</p>

<p>“Too much. It is disconcerting to gather in upward of a
million unintentionally.”</p>

<p>“A million? <i>John!</i> Won’t you tell us how you did it? I
never tire of your coups.”</p>

<p>Dolores felt relieved and extremely glad to see her interest
and pride in her husband. Surely not even the exacting
Catherine could fail to care for such a man! In that moment
between demand and response, she decided definitely to forget
as unworthy of herself, of the mother of Jack and of
John Cabot the presumptions of the Marquis d’Elie. Undoubtedly
they were&mdash;well, just d’Elie’s presumptions.</p>

<p>“And you never will tire, eh, so long as I win?” John’s
somewhat cynical glance transferred from his wife’s
Heaven-blue eyes to those of his longtime friend. “I’ve
spoken to you before, Rufus, of having been nagged for the
past year by an idea that Europe has been suffering less
from the effects of war than from the effects of peace.
Some time ago I underwrote a loan to help the Poles against
the Bolsheviki. With the ‘Red’ army threatening Warsaw
from the north and east, it looked for a while as if my investment
in real peace was to be wiped out.”</p>

<p>“And to-day the cables brought the news&mdash;&mdash;” inserted
Holt.</p>

<p>“Exactly.” John shrugged as if at catastrophe. “After
Weygand broke the Russian center and retired the right,
none of the host that swept down on the Polish capital survived
but a handful of fugitives.”</p>

<p>To this laconic recital of the high-finance of war, the
feminine contingent listened with diverse interest. To
Dolores it was evident that, for their benefit, he had stripped
of technicalities some gigantic map-changing feat to which
he had played financial generalissimo. She, too, was stirred
by his success, even though her casual perusal of newspaper
headlines scarcely fitted her to grasp its entirety. From
watching the grown-up of Jack’s whimsical smile, she turned
again to enjoy the reflex of triumph on Catherine’s alert
face.</p>

<p>“It would seem that your guardian angel is working overtime
when you can’t lose even to the grasping Soviet.
Isn’t it just <i>too</i> pathetic!” The unwonted gleam still lit her
eyes, as she turned them upon the governess. “Can’t you,
my dear, say something to cheer this victim of good luck?”</p>

<p>At the direct appeal, Dolores straightened. She must not
fail Mrs. Cabot who was trying so kindly to bring her out,
she adjured herself. To be dull when so much had been
done to brighten her was rank ingratitude. She must
be gay.</p>

<p>“Would that I were witty, like you good folks!” she
wished, with a shy, admiring glance among them.</p>

<p>“And aren’t you?” Holt asked.</p>

<p>“I used to try hard to be. I never was quite comfortable
until I gave it up. It was like release from bondage when I
decided one day to be just sincere. I do sincerely congratulate
Mr. Cabot&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever change your mind,” the enthusiastic
lawyer interrupted. “Scarce were we properly introduced,
Miss Trent and I, when by this sincerity which she depreciates
she thrilled me with a beautiful perception.”</p>

<p>“How nice, Rufus, that you still thrill,” Catherine commented
with a particularly guileless smile.</p>

<p>“Over anything that is good of its kind,” he amplified.
“Such success as I have had at the bar, I owe to that
capacity. To me nothing can be more thrilling than the
sudden sight of human character. This perception that I
have had&mdash;this beautiful sight that I have seen&mdash;&mdash; Perhaps,
John, you will let me toast it with your wonderful
wine?”</p>

<p>At his host’s encouraging nod, Holt arose and fixed his
eyes on the frieze with the twitching smile of inspiration.
After a pause, he began:</p>

<p>“I do not give you Wine, Woman and Song. No, nothing
so new as that! But it is a song I give&mdash;a song of
woman and wine. In varying vintages we drink inspiration
from the sweetness or tartness, the smoothness, gentleness
and headiness of women&mdash;we men. From the Cocktail Girl,
of whom a little is enough, to good old Mother Cordial, who
calms us with her seasoned satisfactions, we have much to
enjoy. Here is Champagne.”</p>

<p>Lifting from beside his plate the tall-stemmed glass half-full
of bubbling amber, he bowed toward the yellow velvet
vision.</p>

<p>“How it sparkles, infects our moods, dares us into animation!
If only it would never let us down to normal again&mdash;would
never cease to sparkle&mdash;Champagne!”</p>

<p>As if by chance, his boyish smile left Catherine’s pleased
face and strayed Dolores’ way. With a kiss of the rim, he
replaced the tall glass upon the cloth. His fingers loosed its
slender stem; found a smaller glass; raised it.</p>

<p>“Once in a lifetime you meet a woman who is like this
deep red Burgundy. Does it need to speak&mdash;the wine&mdash;to
boast its color, its fragrance, its power? See, it is too rich
for the eye to penetrate; there is not a bubble in it to suggest
its life; it is topped by no froth. All too quietly, it
offers us sensation. And we sip of it&mdash;delight. And we
drink deep&mdash;intoxication.</p>

<p>“The woman who is like the deep, red wine&mdash;once in a
lifetime we meet her. No need for her to laugh with us, to
coquette, even to speak. Her personality is an alluring hue.
She gives off a fragrance of soul that drowns gross thought.
Without words she promises all emotions&mdash;life. She, like
the wine, needs only to be.</p>

<p>“I do not give you Wine, Woman and Song; nothing so
new as that. I sing, friends, an older song&mdash;<i>the</i> woman,
man’s wine!”</p>

<p>Silence held the little group as Holt ceased to speak. With
his left hand he patted the bald spot upon his head, as if
doubtful of the wisdom of having broached his “beautiful
perception.” Then, slowly, his smile reappeared, as though
from frank pleasure over a creditable performance. With
lifted glass he turned to their host.</p>

<p>Dolores also turned.</p>

<p>But John Cabot did not meet their gaze&mdash;either her own
or that of his friend. And he did not speak. He was, however,
the first to drain his Burgundy.</p>

<p>The girl wondered at the gleam in his eyes. Never had
she seen him look that way before. It seemed soon for even
so excellent a potion to have had effect.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</h3>
</div>

<p>Falltime was well gone for the year. Yet in the rigors
of winter a flower came to bloom in the heart of Dolores
Trent. Petal-soft had opened the peace of her to-day.
Warm-hued glowed the hope of to-morrow. As though
none such ever had pricked her mind were the thorn-fears
of yesterday.</p>

<p>She first consciously viewed the miracle on a sharply
bright afternoon when she and young Jack had crossed the
Avenue for one of the strolls in Central Park which she was
teaching him to enjoy. The fact that she had reached content
glinted into her realization from off the sunlight. The
green grass surviving the patches of snow, the birds darting
hither and yon on their unaccountable errands, the branches
swaying tractably to the breeze&mdash;each sight and sound about
them accented the harmony with Nature of her changed
mood. Hitherto, memories of her past had spoiled the present
with dread of what the future might be. To-day the
past was crowded into its proper position as the mere background
of her life. So full of enjoyment was the present
that she seemed almost&mdash;<i>almost</i> to have reached the future.</p>

<p>And her mental state seemed to have blessed her charge
like a benediction. No longer did the cripple’s features twist
into snarls at sight of more agile children at play. To his
precocious mind had been submitted the law of compensation.
Constantly reminding himself that there was meant to
be no perfect earthly state, he compared nurse-maids and
mothers unfavorably with his governess-pal; buttoned his
coat thoughtfully when he passed a youngster in rags who
could run; tilted his head farther to one side when a rheumy-eyed
wreck of a father on a bench pointed the contrast with
that of his god-man, his “John Cabot.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> fun being happy,” he asserted gnomically.</p>

<p>“It is&mdash;it is,” she agreed, with conviction equal to his own.</p>

<p>“I think I have learned how to be happy more from you,
’Lores, than from Dick. But I don’t mind acknowledging
that I was all wrong about the way I treated him before
you came. Don’t you think he ’preciates, though, that I’ve
tried to make it up to him? The way he pecks around my
fingers when I hold his lettuce-leaf shows he’s not afraid of
me any more. And the way he <i>sings</i>! ’Lores, when he
perks his head on one side, just like John and me, and
fixes his shiny eyes on mine&mdash;&mdash; D’you know, I think he
is awful fond of me, ’spite of the way I acted. It makes me
feel&mdash;&mdash;” In the act of drooping, the over-large, brown-cropped
head threw bravely back. “It makes me <i>ashamed</i>,”
he finished. “Don’t you suppose we could let Dick out of
the cage a while each day, just to give him a little the feeling
that he’s free?”</p>

<p>“Of course we could, Jackie. I am sure he’d soon learn
to stay inside your rooms. He has more philosophy than
you’d credit to his size or he’d never sing as he does in a
cage.”</p>

<p>The lad’s eyes up-flashed a radiant look. “I’d be relieved
a lot to see Dick get something out of his life. I’d feel a
better right to enjoy something awful wonderful that’s going
to happen to me to-day. You won’t be cross that I’ve kept it
a secret from you? I wanted to s’prise you. But I intended
all along to tell you first of anybody. ’Lores&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His slithering gait stopped in the center of the path that
he might grasp her two hands instead of the one. Through
the fur lining of his gloves she could feel the jump of his
pulse. Looking down, she saw a sort of solemn joy upon
his wizened little face. From under the beautiful sweep of
his lashes gleamed what she had not seen there before, tears.</p>

<p>“John’s going to bring me the dog, ’Lores,” he announced
in a voice surcharged with unchildlike feeling. “I never
asked him again after that day. You know&mdash;the day you
came&mdash;when two of the gold-fish died? It was he took that
magazine with the kennel advertisement I had marked. You
remember that we never could find it? That was a long
time ago and I was afraid John had forgotten. But he
hadn’t. I guess he never forgets anything. He saved the
address and he’s got me one of the breed of that picture. It
means more to me than getting what he’s never let me have,
a live puppy. It means&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That your father trusts you now. Oh, Jack darling, I
am so glad for you!” With emotion equal to his own
Dolores filled in when the child-voice broke.</p>

<p>“And, ’Lores&mdash;&mdash;” excitement fortified him, “he’s bringing
it to-day&mdash;probably this very hour. I left word with
Bradish the direction we were taking and just where we’d
rest. But I guess, after all, we’d better go back. My dog
mightn’t like it if I wasn’t home when he arrived. Naturally
he’ll be anxious to get acquainted with his boy. Let’s start
back.”</p>

<p>Despite Dolores’ readiness, he still hesitated.</p>

<p>“I kind of don’t feel that I dare be so happy, ’Lores, when
I know you get sorry sometimes. You’re not to be sorry any
more. I’ve explained to John about why I want to take care
of you always. I’m not too little now to look after you and
when I grow up I intend to make you awful happy. I’d like
to tell you now that special name for you that I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The girl had to lean low to catch his confession. But
not for all the lesser joys of her life would she have missed
it. On her knees in the gravel of the path she held him for
one precious moment to her heart. Although quickly she
restrained herself in order not to offend his idea of big-boy
decorum and although the homeward pace set by his physical
limitations was slow, she seemed to walk on air&mdash;seemed to
have realized in her virginity the joy of motherhood.</p>

<p>For once Jack’s anxiety to precede his hero home had been
well advised. It took time to reach the nearest exit, then
to retrace their steps up-town along the pavement that
fronted the park wall. Scarcely had they come opposite the
Cabot block when they saw John in riding clothes about to
mount the white Arabian which was the chief of his relaxations.</p>

<p>Scuttling to his side the curb, John, Jr., announced their
return in his lustiest shout. Dolores understood the excitement
which had snatched his hand from hers when she
noticed that a scraggly Airedale puppy was tucked under the
left parental elbow.</p>

<p>For the moment the “Stop” sign of the traffic policeman
at the crossing just below had cut off the flow of vehicles.
John Cabot, hearing and seeing his son, returned to the
groom the reins of his horse. By neck-nap he held up the
wriggling symbol of re-established faith; then, stooping,
set the young dog on his feet and started him across the
street to meet the lad who had earned his ownership.</p>

<p>Jack’s whistle of encouragement was out-shrilled by the
“Go” blast from below. The puppy, despite the wobbliness
of his legs, evidently had lived to learn. The louder the
whistle, the stronger the canine obligation. His stub tail
straight up, his square-chopped jowl low, his ears flat-pointed
toward his goal, he set off in form that would have done
proud his bull-terrier and otter-hound ancestors toward the
policeman down the street.</p>

<p>Jack took after him. At a pace of which Dolores would
not have believed him capable, with his overly-long arms
outstretched and his head lopping well to one side, he slithered
regardlessly into the crush of traffic. As one, the
father and the governess realized his danger. From opposite
curbs, both started after him. The Airedale, although debarred
by youth from discrimination, showed that he had
inherited speed. But Jack, urged beyond thought of self by
desire to rescue his new and dear possession, gained in the
pursuit. Lunging close, he reached for the waggling stub
tail. Almost did he grasp it. Almost did he, as well as the
dog, reach the safety zone.</p>

<p>On the right side of the Avenue, John Cabot had been
hindered by the up-streaking cars. On the left, Dolores
might have been in time, except that a misguided citizen,
seeing a woman rush directly in front of a heavy car, laid
violent hands upon her and dragged her back. Her shriek
mingled with the automobile’s siren. Above both warnings
the traffic whistle shrilled and shrilled again.</p>

<p>The movement of the street scene suddenly ceased. Each
car was brought up short. Pedestrians stood to stare, as if
under some horrid spell. Even the puppy paused at the
repetition of the command which before had moved him.
At the worst possible moment for the continuation of the
house of Cabot, a sport car had spun around the corner.</p>

<p>The case was one of the present-day many too brief for
emergency brakes. The tires smoked with the startled
driver’s shout. But from the victim there came not the
slightest protest.</p>

<p>In another moment, all was motion again. John Cabot
gathered the lax form of his son into his arms. A detached
look was on his face as he answered the questions of the
policeman and other eye witnesses. But while he nodded
vaguely and gave his name and address in a quiet voice, he
remembered everything, even the puppy. Dolores took up
the search of his eyes; followed and picked up the confused
little dog. She felt a resentment very like hate at the insinuating
way he wagged his tail, as though trying to humbug
her into approval of his conduct When she rejoined
John&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Come, Dolores,” he said.</p>

<p>Always before he had called her “Miss Trent.”</p>

<p>When they reached the wrought-iron gate into the Cabot
grounds he stepped aside for her to precede him. That he
should think of the puppy and her before himself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Even in that first full hour, she was impressed by these
small remembrances. They told her more of the man than
all the greater things which had been accredited to him.</p>

<p>She it was who led the way around the clustered shrubbery
and past the dryad of the cynical smirk. At the steps she
had to right herself from stumbling. Although she was not
weeping, she could not see.</p>

<p>“Jackie.... <i>Jack!</i>”</p>

<p>She had not spoken his name; merely had thought it in a
hurting dread for herself as well as for him. Was catastrophe
always to follow her? Had she brought it upon the boy by
growing so close to him through love? That name he had
revealed&mdash;his “secret” name for her&mdash;had that aught to do
with the close-heeling of tragedy?</p>

<p>“Other mother,” was what he had called her.</p>

<p><i>Other mother!</i></p>

<p><i>No.</i> The accident was to have been. It could not occur
because he had whispered a precious name. With passionate
jealousy, she defended his tribute. She would&mdash;she <i>must</i>
have that.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Along about midnight and quite unexpectedly, Jack
became conscious. His mind seemed to open with his eyes.
He saw his father first, seated on one side of the historic
bed, then glanced about until he found Dolores on the other.</p>

<p>From the outer room could be heard the deep-breathing
of the celebrated surgeon who had performed the operation.
He had preferred to spend the night there, awaiting results.
The nurse, too, had been persuaded to a brief rest, since
Mr. Cabot and the governess elected to keep the watch.</p>

<p>The mother who, all evening, had been in a “state” of
grief bordering on hysteria, had been retired to her own
apartment by one of her headaches and Dr. Shayle. A
remark made to the osteopath in a quite calm voice, however,
had suggested that already she had found relief from
the shock.</p>

<p>“It will be better when it is all over,” she had said, turning
with one of her quavering, childlike smiles from placing a
rose between her son’s unresponsive fingers. “A lame lad
couldn’t have gone far in this rapid age.”</p>

<p>Dolores, overhearing, felt a sensation new to her. By
contrast with its violence, she knew that it was not hate she
felt for the puppy. This was the first hate that had racked
her&mdash;this feeling for Catherine Cabot. “All over”&mdash;his
mother to anticipate <i>that</i>!</p>

<p>Now that the boy’s eyes had opened and widened with
relief to find herself and John by the bed, the suggestion
seemed more inhuman than before. She reached across to
take away the rose of such cruel suggestiveness.</p>

<p>But Jack’s fingers now closed around the stem. His lips
moved.</p>

<p>Both she and his father leaned close.</p>

<p>“Evening, John Cabot.”</p>

<p>“Jack Cabot, good evening.” In an effortful murmur the
older John made his usual reply.</p>

<p>“And you, ’Lores&mdash;&mdash; I am glad you are both&mdash;&mdash; Don’t
have anyone else&mdash;&mdash;” Jack’s voice dwindled. Then soon
he roused again. “If a picture was taken&mdash;of my heart, it
would show&mdash;just two faces, John’s and ’Lores’. You’ll take
my place, John&mdash;with Lores? You’ll try to make her happy&mdash;like
I meant to do? She never was&mdash;happy, you know&mdash;until
she and Dick and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The father’s whispered reassurance Dolores tried not to
hear, just as she tried not to see the look on his face. But
without ears or eyes she must have heard and seen. Her
heart was near breaking with grief for the two Johns.</p>

<p>“Anything you decide&mdash;all right with me. I can trust&mdash;her
with you. I’d like to see&mdash;my dog.”</p>

<p>Dolores lifted the young Airedale, which had been biting
at her skirt, to the edge of the bed and kept her hand on his
collar while he wobbled over the coverlet and licked, in his
boisterous, insinuating way, the outstretched hand of “his
boy.” Soon she drew him away and replaced him on the
floor, from where he whimpered and coaxed to get up again.</p>

<p>John, the while, had replaced the rose in his son’s searching
hand.</p>

<p>They two sat watching the fingers that began to tear apart
its petals.</p>

<p>“You are wasting your rose, Jackie dear,” Dolores said,
to keep his thoughts distracted from the puppy.</p>

<p>He paused, but evidently not at her protest. The twittering
of his canary in the other room seemed to disturb him.</p>

<p>“Poor Dick, he’s taking it hard,” he said and returned to
the destruction of the rose.</p>

<p>After all the petals lay plucked on the coverlet, he gathered
them up in both hands. His gaze, too, settled on the
sight of the crimson life-leaves sifting through his pale
fingers.</p>

<p>“See, they look prettier&mdash;and smell sweeter&mdash;than before,”
he urged, his voice loudening from his effort to reassure
them. “The rose isn’t wasted. Nothing ever is. Even
I&mdash;am not wasted. I’ve never been what other boys&mdash;are.
But I’m glad I’ve lived long enough to ’preciate you, John.
Maybe if I hadn’t&mdash;you and ’Lores&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His voice was cut by a hurting gasp. They hovered close
over him, watching the changes&mdash;from physical pain to
mental relief&mdash;which drifted like sunshine after shadows
over his face.</p>

<p>Dolores would gladly have died to save him one pang; yet
all she could do was to share his suffering. Her heart
stopped beating from relief when the dark, appealing lashes
swept back again. From far away, yet intensely, he looked
up at them.</p>

<p>“Remember, John and ’Lores, <i>nothing’s</i>&mdash;<i>ever</i>&mdash;<i>wasted</i>”</p>

<p>As he spoke, a light not from the night lamp was shafted
into the room. Direct as a search-ray it found his face and
settled there.</p>

<p>At its touch Jack lifted to one elbow on the pillow, forgetful
of pain; gazed with an alert look into its unearthly
radiance; leant his head to one side, as if listening.</p>

<p>“I will come. I am coming,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, not yet, Jack&mdash;don’t go yet!” At last moved from
his outer calm, the father threw forward his body to screen
off the sourceless shaft. But not the faintest shadow showed.
Through his brawn the light glowed steadily. With a groan
he slid to his knees beside the ancestral bed and stretched
clutching hands across the counterpane as if longing, yet not
daring to drag back into the semi-gloom the last of the line.</p>

<p>His appeal sounded desperate&mdash;tortured from him.</p>

<p>“How can you leave me, boy? You are part of me, Jack
Cabot. Don’t you realize that? You are all that I have.
Don’t go yet awhile, my son&mdash;little crushed bone of my
bone!”</p>

<p>Perhaps Jack heard. Perhaps he should have preferred
to wait, if only for the “while” that his man-god craved.
But his eyes did not lower from the blinding light or his
head relax from its listening slant. Any courteous desire
which he may have had to stay was overruled by the authoritative
command that had reached him. In a last effort
to reassure the beloved two he must leave behind, he tried
to smile&mdash;was able to whisper:</p>

<p>“I am not&mdash;afraid.... I see&mdash;the way.... The
light&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Through the numbness that made one pain of her heart
and her head, Dolores remembered sometime afterward that
unprecedented midnight twittering which had disturbed the
boy. Softly, so as not to awaken the great surgeon, she
crossed the living-room to the window. The canary
greeted her with no flutter of wings. She lifted the cage off
its hook, carried it into the bedroom and placed it beside
the night lamp.</p>

<p>She and John Cabot stood in the utter silence which
seemed to fill the world, looking through the wires at the
fluffed, yellow body that lay upon the floor of the cage.
Indeed Dick had taken it “hard.” Jack’s wish for the small
creature whose large love had made him “ashamed” was
fulfilled. His bird, too, had gone&mdash;set free.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h3>
</div>

<p>In justice to John Cabot, the spirit-girl Dolores related
next an interview between the financier and his wife of
which she was told afterward. So she explained to her
demon audience when able to proceed.</p>

<p>Three days had passed since that incomprehensible thing
misnamed on Earth as “life” had departed the unsightly
physical of the young heir. The great surgeon, after having
established&mdash;to his own satisfaction at least&mdash;that the patient
had died of “nerve shock” and not of an operation which he
pronounced successful in all details, had departed with his
check. The servants were recovering from the emotional
debauch of the last offices and beginning to think consciously,
rather than subconsciously, in terms of tasks.</p>

<p>The governess, immediately on her return from the cemetery
where had been consigned to dust her second safe
love, had sought the boy’s mother in her boudoir. She had
come, she said, to express her appreciation of the many
kindnesses heaped upon her and to announce her departure,
since her engagement had come to so sudden and sad an end.</p>

<p>Catherine, however, had insisted that she stay on in the
house; in a pitiful outburst had clung to her as the one who
had been nearest and dearest to the departed lad. Time
enough later to decide in what capacity she should remain.
Her gentle companionship was “comforting” to the bereaved
mother. She must not “desert.”</p>

<p>Dolores had hesitated, riven with doubts. She felt that
she should go. Yet she longed to stay. Catherine was
suffering from one of the headaches which would seem to
have become chronic. Fragrant and pale as a valley-lily
in her crepe, she looked a lovely child, dependent upon kindness.
Dolores glanced away from the dew-wet eyes and
compared her own sense of loss with what a mother’s must
be. Although she had not forgotten that brutal anticipation
of Jack’s death, hate hurt. Catherine looked in need of
forgiveness and she&mdash;&mdash; She <i>needed</i> to forgive.</p>

<p>She was considering the somewhat vague disposal of her
near future when Mr. Cabot knocked. Advised by the set
look of his face and his grave manner, she at once excused
herself; left them alone. Following is the conversation
between them, as reported to her later on.</p>

<p>“This is the first time in several years that you, my wedded
lord, have visited my rooms. To what do I owe the rather
unusual honor?” Catherine asked.</p>

<p>“To a rather unusual request.”</p>

<p>John did not draw up the chair toward which she had
waved him. He stood through the interview&mdash;stood or
paced from one object to another of the luxurious room.
At times he stopped quite near the <i>chaise longue</i> where she
sat propped up by cushions, to study her guileless face and
the suffering air with which she sniffed a gold bottle of salts.</p>

<p>“The boy is dead, Catherine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, John.”</p>

<p>“I loved the boy.”</p>

<p>“I believe you did. Still, he must have been a great disappointment
to a fine specimen like you.”</p>

<p>The compliment was repeated in her appreciative, uplifted
gaze. But he felt far from pleased.</p>

<p>“You will oblige me by not referring to Jack’s infirmity
again. He was the only creature I’ve had to love since my
mother, and I loved him as he was. You and I, Catherine,
should be the last to depreciate him for what he symbolized.”</p>

<p>“Symbolized? Oh, don’t tell me that again!”</p>

<p>“Your criticism forces me to remind you. Outwardly our
son was the symbol of our malformed union.”</p>

<p>“<i>John</i>, what a grim thought!”</p>

<p>“Grim as the inheritance law&mdash;even to the third and fourth
generation. He paid the price in his person of our crime in
giving him birth. Through our fault, not his own, his body
was warped and his temper uncertain. I often remembered
when I looked at him&mdash;remembered that no amount of love
was enough to atone for the wrong we had done him. I, for
one, am grateful that we three were spared the greater
punishment. So easily, in the sardonic scheme of things,
the soul of him, too, might have been warped. But his was
as gallant and large and sweet as ever outgrew injustice.”</p>

<p>The implications against herself had turned Catherine to
one of the many mirrors conveniently placed.</p>

<p>“How can you take such stern pride in your loyalty? You
used to say, you know, that you loved me.”</p>

<p>He, also, studied her reflection.</p>

<p>“I suppose you would call that a self-respecting statement?
All right, we’ll give it the benefit of my doubt that it is
mere vanity. I did love what I thought you were. But that
was taken away, like my mother&mdash;like Jack.”</p>

<p>She showed the flurry that caught her up whenever
inspired by one of her “brainy” thoughts.</p>

<p>“Has a man a right to think things about a woman
which aren’t true, marry her on the strength of them and
then blame her for the rest of their unnatural lives because
he made a mistake?”</p>

<p>“In our case I had&mdash;every right. Have you forgotten
the details of our first meeting, Catherine? Your father had
invited me to the house really to see you, not the pictures he
hoped to sell me. Your mother had selected me, sight
unseen, by virtue of my bank account. They helped you to
make an impression on me which all of you knew to be
false. You were dressed in white, which you afterward told
me you never expected to wear again until your funeral.
You looked innocent and tender and dependent&mdash;all of which
you were not. You sat upon a hassock and played with a
white Persian kitten&mdash;oh, every detail of the studied effect
made a lasting impression upon me! You had well-developed
claws then, but you held them in far more carefully than did
the kitten. Later, I learned, with quite a shock, that you
detested cats. Yet you held this one to your cheek and
understudied its appeal to the best of your feline ability.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for admitting that I have some sort of ability,”
the gentle voice purred.</p>

<p>“You have more than ability. You have positive power.”</p>

<p>“My dear John! But don’t pay me all your stored-up
compliments in one visit. Save some and call again.”</p>

<p>“You have that most potent of acquisitive forces, unassailable
egotism. I used to look into the faces of the painted
parasites riding along Fifth Avenue in their cars and wonder
why so much was laid at their feet. That was before I
learned&mdash;<i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“To think that you, John, should learn anything from
me!”</p>

<p>“Egotism is the most acquiring force in the world. All
great men have it, but in them it is covered or excused by
their greatness. All women successful with men have it to
the degree of a sort of hypnotism. They blind men to what
they are with the bright light of what they think they are.
You, for instance, think so well of yourself that one needs
strong lenses to see your faults. I used to hope that you’d
dim some day&mdash;have a doubt of yourself. But you never
did. You are all strength in your egotism.”</p>

<p>Hard words they were, yet sadly spoken. During them
the beautiful subject had wavered between pique and pleasure.
At their finish, she offered her child-sweet laugh.</p>

<p>“After this, I can refuse you nothing. Name the rather
unusual favor which you say you have come to ask!”</p>

<p>“I wish you, Catherine, to get a divorce.”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;<i>you</i> want a divorce?”</p>

<p>Astonishment overcame both pique and pleasure.</p>

<p>“The boy was our only link. Now that he is gone, free
me. You may have the money&mdash;as much of it as you want.
I can make more. Of late I’ve had literally forced on me
plenty of that which is my value in your eyes. I’ll try to
meet any demands you make. You see, I assume that you
have no reason other than money for keeping up this pretense
longer.”</p>

<p>“So, it has come to this?”</p>

<p>Both face and form relaxed as she coaxed the cushions to
give her greater comfort. The astonishment in her eyes had
been replaced by shrewdness; that, in turn, by mild amusement.
But the golden lines of her eye-brows were arched,
as always when she was at mental tension.</p>

<p>“Do you intend this request, my hitherto immaculate John,
to be taken as a confession of guilt?”</p>

<p>“<i>Guilt?</i>”</p>

<p>The one repeated word, weighted by disgust, was the whole
of his denial.</p>

<p>“Whence&mdash;where&mdash;how, then, a divorce, without <i>cause</i>?
Are we not citizens of the supposedly respectable commonwealth
of New York?”</p>

<p>“There is Reno.”</p>

<p>“<i>Reno!</i>” As if from force of her emphasis, Catherine
sprang up from her lounge, crossed the room and faced him.
“So you’ve been calculating on Reno? A nice, chivalrous
plan&mdash;for <i>me</i> to endure such tedium and long-suffering to
oblige you with a divorce! Four days’ train travel from
New York and six months’ residence in a Wild West town in
the kind of hotel that has only one bath to a floor and
wouldn’t know what you meant by <i>à la carte</i> if you spelled
it backward and translated it into Indian. My dear husband,
what could you offer that would repay me for one of those
awful exiles in Nevada’s make-believe metropolis?”</p>

<p>“What sum has d’Elie named?”</p>

<p>“<i>John!</i> Are you trying to insult me?”</p>

<p>“No, Catherine. I am trying to settle with you.”</p>

<p>For a tight-strung moment man and wife regarded each
the other, he not unkindly, she with twisting lips. The next,
she turned and herself began to glide from object to object of
the room, as if she too were strange to them. When she
again stopped before him, her face had beautified. She laid
a hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>“Tell me, <i>why</i> a divorce, dear?”</p>

<p>“Why not a divorce?” His eyes held forbiddingly on
the clutch of her polish-pointed fingers. “Let’s not go into
unnecessary explanations. I understand something of your
ambitions and shall be glad to help you achieve them. You
will wear a title well&mdash;one thing that I could never give you.
And you’ll do better, I am sure, with a man whose devotion
is for hire.”</p>

<p>“A beautiful sentiment, as Clarke Shayle would say,” she
commented. “It is fortunate that I didn’t marry you for
any supposed amiability. As for yourself?”</p>

<p>“As for myself&mdash;&mdash;” He flung off the hand that still
clung, a note of passion in his voice. “Has your memory
utterly failed you, Catherine? Can’t you or won’t you
remember what I used to be? Once I tried to make you
understand something of what I hoped from life and love.
Do you suppose that it has been comfortable for me to
appear a stone man? You don’t want me. Let me find a life&mdash;perhaps
even love&mdash;for myself. Oh, Catherine, you used
at least to seem kind in the early days! Try to be a little
kind again.”</p>

<p>“Just kind enough to free you. And <i>she</i>?”</p>

<p>Certainly there was no promise in the bite of her response
or the curiosity with which she eyed the emotion on his
face.</p>

<p>In reply to her question, John Cabot simply looked at her&mdash;a
warning look, known and feared on the Street.</p>

<p>“This lady with whom you hope to find life and love&mdash;did
she suggest the plan to lay me on the shelf?” Catherine
inquired. “It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good, they say.
Of course I can’t blame her for wishing to take advantage
of poor Jack’s death by&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That will do, Catherine.” He voiced the warning look.
“There is no other woman in my life.”</p>

<p>As if relieved of an unhappy suspicion, she lifted a smile
of the self-believing sort which ten years before would have
blinded him to the lies behind her lips.</p>

<p>“Then why,” she asked, “suggest the Union Pacific&mdash;the
road to Reno? How can you, a mere husband, feel sure
that you know your wife’s heart? I defy the laws of Nevada
or any other state to give you the key. What if I should say
that I still do want you?”</p>

<p>“You cannot say that and speak the truth.”</p>

<p>In his positiveness she saw that her past power to beguile
him indeed was gone. But no ineffectualness on that account
depressed her, as proved by the light laugh with which she
returned to the pleasanter assurances of her mirror.</p>

<p>“You are right. I hope you are as grateful as I am that
I can’t. I’d be bored to extinction with the ordinary state
called ‘marital bliss,’ either with a man who doted upon me
or one upon whom I doted. Fact is&mdash;&mdash;” Bending closer
to the glass, she focused into the twin pair of eyes a look
of assured capability, “I never did care for you. Lately I
quite dislike you. You are, you know, superior. I don’t
wish to be superior myself and I resent people who are.
There now! You say you like honesty&mdash;won’t you give me
a good mark?”</p>

<p>With one of her unaccountable transitions, her manner
changed from frank spite to pathos. Brushing her hand
across her eyes, as if to hide from him any sign of the
feeling to which she had declared herself immune, she crossed
to the window and leaned, looking out, against the effective
background of its bronze hanging.</p>

<p>“No, my only husband&mdash;the answer is no.” The cynicism
in what she said was weakened by the way she said it. “I’m
sorry to refuse any little request of yours, but I cannot give
you up. And I don’t think, really, that you have been quite
nice. Since the challenge was to come from you, you might
have been heroic enough to let me name the weapons&mdash;swords
or pistols, you know&mdash;that impossible Reno or New
York. Don’t you think yourself that you have added insult
to injury?”</p>

<p>He did not dignify the appeal with a reply. He was about
to go; had bowed to her formally and was crossing to the
door.</p>

<p>“John, dear.”</p>

<p>Her quavery cry stopped him on the threshold.</p>

<p>She followed him and stood with her gold-gloried head
hung low over her twisting hands. “You say I have lost all
kindness, John. I think <i>you</i> have. You are not what you
used to be, any more than am I. You haven’t had a thought
for me in what you ask. Perhaps a man cannot realize
what it means to a woman to&mdash;to be faced with a demand
like yours of to-day. For me to divorce you for deserting
me&mdash;to admit to our world that you have tired of me&mdash;&mdash; Even
supposing there is nothing to me but what you say,
don’t you know that would crucify my vanity? But there
is more to me, John. I once <i>was</i> that kitten-girl you thought
me. At times&mdash;even yet&mdash;I have my softer feelings. I am
used to compliments and I&mdash;I am hurt to the heart by your
insult.”</p>

<p>John did not take advantage of her pause. He continued
to wait and wonder.</p>

<p>“I see far less beautiful women than I being understood
and appreciated,” she continued after a quivering sigh. “Is
it too much that I ask to be endured? And yet, I don’t want
to ask that&mdash;I really don’t. I want you to be happy, but&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
John, why couldn’t you have waited until I’d recovered?
What with the accident and poor Jack’s death and the funeral
and now <i>this</i>, I feel that I’ve had almost more than I can
stand. To-day my head aches until&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Again she paused. And again he did not speak.</p>

<p>“Dr. Shayle says that I ought to go away somewhere for a
change of air and scene,” she continued after a moment, in
a lower, more pathetic voice. “I was hesitating, in my mistaken
viewpoint, feeling that I shouldn’t leave you in the
house alone just at this time. But after what you’ve said to
me I see that you’d be glad to have me go. I’ll start
to-morrow for&mdash;for somewhere&mdash;anywhere.”</p>

<p>Soon her sobs allowed her to add: “And I’ll think things
over while I’m gone, dear. Perhaps, when I get used to your
idea, it won’t sound so brutal as it does to-day. I just <i>might</i>
come to see it more your way. Or perhaps you will miss me
enough to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He realized that she was giving him every chance, but
still failed to improve it.</p>

<p>With only a reproachful glance for his lack of generosity,
she changed the subject. “I want to speak to you about one
thing in particular. It’s Miss Trent. As you may know, I
have conceived an unusual affection for her. I don’t feel
that we should send a young creature of her beauty and fatal
charm out into the world again. On account of her devotion
to Jackie and the wonderfully good influence she exerted
over him, I feel the responsibility of seeing her safely settled,
either with us or elsewhere. She is really quite refined.
And how her looks came out in that evening dress I&mdash;we
gave her! For one, I don’t intend that the he-wolves outside
shall get on the trail again of a girl who was so dear to our&mdash;our
boy.”</p>

<p>“Your sentiments do you proud, Catherine.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be sarcastic, John. You may think I have no heart,
but there are people who wouldn’t agree with you. Dolores,
for instance. I show her every day my appreciation for what
she did for Jack.”</p>

<p>“And I intend to show mine,” John inserted quietly, “by
some suitable arrangement and provision. Jack’s last request
was that I look out for her. I, too, have a high opinion of
Miss Trent.”</p>

<p>“Then do, John, unbend toward her! You treat her&mdash;really&mdash;like
a servant in the house. It offends my finer
sensibilities to see how afraid the poor thing is of you. You
can’t doubt her devotion to the boy. Try to realize, as I do,
that her heart is aching for him almost as much as our own.
Be kinder to her while I’m gone, won’t you, John?”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. I shall be kind to her.”</p>

<p>“I do thank you for that promise. You’re a dear. I
should have worried for fear you’d hurt her hyper-sensitive
feelings in some way&mdash;as&mdash;as you’ve hurt mine. You see,
she has agreed to stay on in the house at least until I get
back. I’ve made her believe that I need someone above
Morrison to look after things in my place.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said John, “I shall move to one of the
clubs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she protested. “Dolores would suspect that you
had been driven out of your home and be most uncomfortable.
It isn’t at all necessary for you to go.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me. I think it is.”</p>

<p>He left her, disappointed and dismayed. The “mere husband”
of her accusation, he felt he must have misunderstood
his wife. That affection for him should outweigh her
cupidity seemed incredible. And yet what else could have
prompted her refusal of his “rather unusual” request?</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</h3>
</div>

<p>Who does not find the intermission tedious after the tragic
second act? The curtain has lowered between you and
knowledge of what the end of the play is to be. Over the
auditorium side of the footlights the indirect glow from dome
and gallery flares. You straighten and turn to your friends.
You see them brush the damp from their eye-lashes; hear
them clear the husk from their voices; appreciate that they,
as well as you, are groping back to reality. But you resent
your friends; resent yourself; resent reality. It is a poor
exchange for the make-believe whose artistry has humbled
a thousand egos into a unit&mdash;an audience.</p>

<p>Because so essentially temporary, the intermission is a
strain. And if to you, how much more to the actors, also
waiting behind the scenes, whose ecstasies have brought the
great sophisticated house to tears!</p>

<p>The week following Mrs. Cabot’s departure from her
Fifth Avenue mansion was one of poignant loneliness for
Dolores Trent. Strangely enough, however, she refused
such companionship as offered. When good Mrs. Morrison
urged that she come down to the cheerful first-floor parlor
at tea-time or in the evenings, she plead the necessity of
brushing-up on the languages upon which she depended for
her next position. So almost painful to one of her yielding
habits were her frequent refusals to see Dr. Shayle that she
left a standing “Not-at-home” with those who answered the
door and telephone.</p>

<p>With none to give her orders, she looked for things to do
and tried to the full of her gentle authority to maintain
discipline in the establishment, as when the Cabots were at
home. That, so far as she knew at the time, was madame’s
chief reason for leaving her in charge. Tactfully she submitted
suggestions for increased orderliness to the housekeeper.
She instructed the yard-man according to her own
ideas of the winter needs of the trees and shrubs under his
charge. A stable-boy, suspected of mistreating his master’s
mount, she brought to confession and a quixotic zeal to make
amends.</p>

<p>But chiefly she waited. Impatient of interruption from
those who wished to be her friends, of the warm, indirect
lighting shafted over her by the Cabot millions, of the comfort
of reality, she merely endured the intermission. Her
imagination strained toward what would be revealed when
the curtain rose again.</p>

<p>The Airedale terrier, that now was not to know the joys of
owning his own “boy,” she made her particular charge.
Although she had resented him from first sight, she came to
take a vicarious pride in his up-bringing and points. Through
Jack’s eyes she watched his development out of puppyhood
into promising young dogship; daily brushed the harsh tan
coat over which the outlines of a black saddle already were
forming; noted with interest that, although scarcely two
months old, his eyes were turning black; attended his diet
herself, lest his canine voracity weaken the bones of his
front legs, now straight as two gun-barrels. In time she felt
for him a comradeship even greater than Jack’s would have
been. Was he not in the same, culpable position which had
saddened her youth? Had not another died for him?</p>

<p>She did not realize how much his demonstrative preference
for her company had gained upon her until one night when
awakened from her early sleep by the ache of loneliness. She
decided to join him in Jack’s living room where he was
allowed to dream his puppy dreams curled up on the foot-stool
that stood as of yore before the lame little autocrat’s
arm-chair. Slipping a warm robe over her nightgown and
loose long hair, she tip-toed in mules along the balcony and
into the suite of so many memories. Scarcely had she closed
the door when the puppy rose to receive her. Although he
stood a picture of preparedness in the center of the room,
instinctively posing after the traditions of his A. K. C.
ancestry when on hunt or show-bench, the waggle of his
short, flagstaff tail and certain quivers of his stiff chin
whiskers assured her that he was delighted she had come.</p>

<p>And Dolores returned his greeting with more than usual
cordiality. She rubbed the level of his back with her foot
and stooped to scratch the section of forehead between the
small, V-shaped ears when he kissed effusively her bare
ankles.</p>

<p>She straightened; for a moment stood listening. The room
was very quiet&mdash;so much quieter than usual. She glanced
at the grandfather’s clock which had ticked through so many
generations of Cabots. The living John had tinkered it to
outlast the life of his heir and it had made good his boast.
Reproachfully Dolores eyed the “calm” face which Jack had
approved. Indeed, a clock needed to be “calm-faced,” when
its office was ticking lives away.</p>

<p>The hour hand was close to eleven. But then, the hour
didn’t matter. Nothing mattered except that Jack was gone.
With the thought, she turned toward the closed bedroom
door. Impossible&mdash;almost too impossible for belief it seemed
that he was not sleeping within. Comparing to-night with
other nights when she had crept in to assure herself that his
sleep was sound, the past seemed real, the now the unreality.
Surely he would be hunched up beneath his eider-down and
satin just as usual.</p>

<p>Moved by her longings, the girl continued across the
living-room; opened, then closed behind her the bedroom
door and stopped beside the bed. Its absolute flatness, the
neat roll of the comforter between its foot-posts, the prim
set of the pillows at its head&mdash;all filled her with realization
keen as actual disappointment. She bunched up the pillows,
threw herself upon them and shook out the comforter over
her. With a sob, she tried to clasp to her heart the delusion
that a twisted little shape lay within her arms.</p>

<p>Before she fell asleep she realized that the puppy had
followed her into the room. He had hidden under the bed,
evidently, until eased of fear over his temerity. Her resistance
of the whimpers with which he soon grew emboldened
kept her awake for a time. What was he&mdash;stupid, brute
atom&mdash;that he presumed to offer comfort for her human
loss? And had not he himself deprived her? Quite roughly
she pushed away his exaggeratedly shivering body and repulsed
his suggestion that he, too, was lonely. Let him
continue to hide from her sight&mdash;let him die of his loneliness!</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;&mdash; In those little-girl days of long ago, had
<i>she</i> died, willing though she might have been to offer that
apology for her existence? What would she have done if the
father whom she had deprived had not been merciful to her?</p>

<p>A damp nose in her down-stretched palm emphasized the
question. She should remember that the creature wasn’t hers
to mistreat. Jack would want his dog given the benefit of
every doubt. She picked up the recent bundle of canine
pathos&mdash;now one of exuberant joy&mdash;and permitted him to
wriggle down upon the coverlet.</p>

<p>A sound louder than his dream barks, then a movement
more definite than the twitching of the four feet co-ordinating
with the speed at which he imagined himself running,
awakened her. Against the slivers of light which outlined
the door-frame, she saw that the puppy was standing at
attention&mdash;hind legs thrust well back, bristles stiff, nose
close to the sill. She sat up and shook herself wider awake.
Someone had entered the sitting-room and made a light.</p>

<p>She would better announce her presence inside than have
the dog bark the announcement for her. With the idea of
returning to her own chamber, she gathered her dressing-gown
close around her and opened the door.</p>

<p>There she stood absolutely still. Everything seemed to
halt with her feet&mdash;the beat of her heart, all capability to
move or speak, even any sense of surprise.</p>

<p>Powerless as she felt looked John Cabot.</p>

<p>He was sitting in Jack’s arm-chair, beside the lamp; was
looking at her. The parts of Jack’s broken, pace-setting toy
were spread out on the table. In both hands he clutched the
torn magazine in which the boy had drawn a circle around
the dog of his choice. He was pale and gaunt.</p>

<p>From the look of him, he must have imagined her a vision.
And she made no move to undeceive him. He was convinced
of the reality of the moment by the puppy. Holding aside
the frisking beast, he straightened and forced himself to
speak.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t stay here, Dolores.”</p>

<p>His words, his frown, his harsh tone&mdash;all stabbed into the
wound of her solitariness as she had not been stabbed when
alone. She could not manage an answer, except to cross to
the hall door. Then, just as her hand turned the knob&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, don’t leave me&mdash;don’t go!” At her distressed
hesitation, he added a jumble of words. “There is
something I’ve been wanting to say to you&mdash;to offer&mdash;about
your future. Forgive me if I seem abrupt or rude. I feel
the strain of&mdash;of recent events. It might help to talk with
someone who understands. Won’t you stay&mdash;a little while?”</p>

<p>Dolores felt more hurt than when he had spoken first, but
hurt for him. Knowing the steel control of the man, she
wondered at his mood. She returned into the room and
stood before him, one thought clear in her mind. So this,
then, was what she had been awaiting all along&mdash;this need
for companionship of John Cabot?</p>

<p>Usually so punctilious about the courtesies, he remained
seated, his knuckles whitening in his grip of the crumpled
magazine. That he now avoided looking at her filled her
with the equivocal sensations of hope and fear which had
unsteadied her that night of the dinner. But she tried not
to feel for herself. She wanted all she was to feel for him.
She saw that he was making an effort to get himself in hand
and wished that she might help him. Yet she hesitated to
speak lest she sound some discordant note.</p>

<p>“I thought it was only Jack I was lonely for&mdash;that sitting
in his room, among his things&mdash;&mdash; But I was deluding
myself. I know that now. The sight of you&mdash;&mdash; Well, it
has not calmed me.”</p>

<p>All too brief a glance he lifted to her startled eyes.</p>

<p>“If I seem strange or&mdash;or incoherent&mdash;&mdash; Dolores, you
never could imagine such loneliness as I’ve been suffering.
Every night since I moved to the club, I’ve been obsessed
with the desire to come here. I knew I shouldn’t trust myself.
Last night I tramped the street until five in the morning
to wear out the wish. But to-night it came back stronger
than before. It has half crazed me&mdash;has worn me out. I&mdash;I
am run down, I guess. I feel like the last half-second of an
eight-day clock.”</p>

<p>At his simile, the girl glanced toward the corner. The
hour hand of the tall old time-piece was exactly where it had
been, close to eleven. She realized why the silence had
seemed so intense when she first had entered the room.
Shocked, she leaned closer to John Cabot.</p>

<p>“Jack’s clock,” she murmured. “I wound it only yesterday.
It has stopped.”</p>

<p>As he, too, turned and looked, his face reflected her superstitious
tone. The quiet increased. Everything in their
world seemed to have stopped.</p>

<p>The young Airedale broke the pause. With a whine and
one paw he importuned the master’s lax-hanging hand. John
pushed him away.</p>

<p>“I owe you worse than nothing, puppy. I meant that Jack
should be considerate of you, but not that he should die for
you.”</p>

<p>The dog appeared to understand; at least, raised his head
and howled dismally.</p>

<p>To hush his weird lament, Dolores sank down upon the
hassock which never more would rest a pair of shrunken
legs; dragged the wretched alien out from under the chair;
stroked and patted him.</p>

<p>“He didn’t intend that Jack should die for him,” she
interceded. “He didn’t intend anything&mdash;any more than I
intended that my mother should die for me. I try not to
hate him. I am sure Jack would know and be distressed if
I did. He’s just a foolish puppy.”</p>

<p>“‘And what is folly, but a riotous expenditure of will?’”
muttered John. His hand sought the head of the dog for
the importuned caress, but spasmodically clasped around
Dolores’. He leaned toward her, although with eyes turned
away, as he continued to quote: “‘There are to will and to
have your will. There are your social ideas, your immoderate
desires, your excesses, your pleasures that end in death,
your sorrows that quicken the pace of life. For pain is
perhaps but a violent pleasure.’”</p>

<p>Then he looked at her. His eyes, dark and brilliant
through a surface film, asked her consideration. Never had
she seen such misery. She had thought it could only be felt
in the heart.</p>

<p>“Do you believe that?” he demanded. “Is the pain that is
wrecking me only a form of pleasure?”</p>

<p>Dolores doubted her voice, but she forced it. It sounded
unsteady as her thoughts. “I wish I knew what to say. I&mdash;I
cannot endure to see you so unhappy. I wish I knew&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There is no heartbreak except deliberate sin. That I keep
telling myself,” he interrupted. “If I am true to Jack’s
trust, true to myself, true to you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His hand slid to her wrist; hesitated there.</p>

<p>“But with the best I can do I am breaking. Everything
has combined to weaken my resistance. Jack, who was your
protector, died and immediately after him the canary.
To-night the clock that has not missed a minute for three
generations of us&mdash;even the old clock gives up.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember what Jack said,” Dolores reminded,
“that nothing is wasted? Maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t start me on that train of thought,” he objected
harshly. “It maddens me. If Jack and his restraining
influence were to die&mdash;if we were to meet here to-night&mdash;if
time for us was to stop&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He clutched her other arm and passed both hands to her
shoulders. One remained there. The other continued
around her neck; forced her face to lift to his; clung to her
throat. The pulse of his fingers beat against the pulse just
under her chin.</p>

<p>“Look at me, Dolores. Keep me seeing the surprise in
your eyes. Do you realize that you have only your inexperience
to protect you?”</p>

<p>She was glad to obey. She looked and looked. And as
she looked, she saw her heaven&mdash;at last her home. Something
lifted that for long had lain a dead-weight on her
heart, a question that now wafted like a fragrance from her
lips.</p>

<p>“You care&mdash;for me?”</p>

<p>“Dolores....”</p>

<p>“You have longed for me as I have longed for you?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know from the first? I tell you to implore
you&mdash;don’t trust me. I am no longer strong, Dolores.
Against my will, against Jack’s faith&mdash;&mdash; Life, position,
integrity&mdash;everything is a trifle to me except the need to
know&mdash;&mdash; Dolores, will you try to understand? Won’t
you forgive and pity me? I am terrified for you. You must
be stronger than I.”</p>

<p>She did not appear to have heard him.</p>

<p>“You love me, then. You <i>love</i> me.”</p>

<p>Over and over again the answer to her question gave sweet
form to her lips. Her head fell back. Her eyes pursued his.</p>

<p>The young Airedale, convinced at last that he was unwelcome,
emerged from under the chair, gave them a reproachful
look, then trotted out of the room. His exit seemed to
impress John anew with their aloneness. He drew up and
away from her.</p>

<p>“Remember,” he warned, “that hopelessness is a dangerous
state. So long as I had hope I was strong. Now that I am
hopeless&mdash;hopeless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It was then that he told her of his interview with Catherine.
Knowing his wife as most did not, he could not
hope to change her private and particular reasons for refusing
to free him. As Clarke Shayle had said, Catherine could
not be “reached.” He had promised Jack to help Dolores
toward a safe future. He was glad of to-night’s opportunity
to learn what she wished that future to be.</p>

<p>But the girl no longer was restrained by his restraint. Now
that she understood, she had no thought of herself except as
it might concern him. And why consider the future in preference
to the here and now? Why lower her eyes from that
first sight of home and heaven?</p>

<p>The admiration and pity which she felt in her mind for
him blended into a yearning desire voluntarily to satisfy the
demands spoken only in the glaze of his eyes, in the pallor of
his face, in the stiff set of his lips.</p>

<p>“Maybe you would be comforted,” she ventured, “to know
how much I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Although he shrank farther back, his fingers, still pressed
against her throat, conducted the tremor that passed through
him.</p>

<p>“I’d give my soul to hear you say it. Surely you know
that? And yet I must not hear&mdash;I dare not hear. Don’t
trust me. Don’t try me.”</p>

<p>“Does love try love?” Her eyes widened incredulously.
“Isn’t love a question, incomplete unless answered? You say
that you care as I do&mdash;that you have cared all along. You
would not tell me if it were not true. You ask me by loving
me. Let me answer. You want to hear me! Don’t you&mdash;<i>don’t</i>
you, John?”</p>

<p>She shook back the loosened hair from her face that he
might see while he heard the truth. She had thought him
pale; now all color left the lips pressed against his teeth.
His hands tightened on her, but to hold her away. Before
to-night she would have been silenced by this continence.
But now that she knew&mdash;&mdash; Everything was different now.</p>

<p>“Don’t repulse me as you did the dog, John. I deserve
your pity more than he. Don’t remind me that since birth
my presence has brought death.”</p>

<p>“Death, Dolores? I never guessed what life could be
until I saw you.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, make me feel that you regard me as a curse?”</p>

<p>“Dear, I am blessed to have known you.”</p>

<p>Her appeal for herself gentled him as those for him could
not do. In his palms he cupped the oval of her cheeks; for
long looked into her eyes. Stiffly, as if compelled against
their inclination by his will, his lips moved.</p>

<p>“So fragrant and pure is the soul of you, but fragile as
the rose that Jack destroyed. You must not be wasted on
me.</p>

<p>“But he said, John, that nothing is ever really wasted, not
even the tears of dew on a rose. They have only their day&mdash;roses.
And hearts have only their day. Why not enjoy them
the more for their little life? Tell me again and read your
answer in my happiness. Is it true&mdash;<i>true</i> that you love me?”</p>

<p>His eyes closed that he might not read; then opened at
once lest he fail.</p>

<p>“I love you with a crave that terrifies me&mdash;only less, I
hope, than my honor&mdash;with a will to protect you from what
you do not understand&mdash;from myself and yourself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Protect love against itself?” Her incredulity silenced
him. “If my heart is a rose that you wish to pluck, John,
take it, crush it, sift its petals through your fingers. If it
brings you a moment’s pleasure, it will not have been wasted.”</p>

<p>His hands recoiled from her face as if from a danger.</p>

<p>But Dolores lifted her arms and laid them around his
neck. She felt no false shame before him. She knew now.</p>

<p>“Take me, John, and crush me. Waste me, since you call
love a waste. I am satisfied to be the rose of your day&mdash;to
give off my fragrance for you.”</p>

<p>He could not have shaken her off had he tried, so overwhelming
was her wish to give him that for which he would
not ask. He sat perfectly still, looking down into her eyes,
listening to what she said. His breath came harder when she
lifted to her knees on the hassock and leaned against him.</p>

<p>“Jack told you to see that I was happy. I cannot be so
while you are unhappy, John. Think of me and take me in
your arms. Let me feel that I belong to you&mdash;that at last I
<i>belong</i>.”</p>

<p>“That first day I saw you, Dolores&mdash;&mdash;” His white lips
again moved in words. “Two visible creatures seemed to
be born of our meeting. The best of me went out to you&mdash;my
love. The best of you appealed to me&mdash;your innocence.
Help me to see them plainly as on that day. Remind me of
your inexperience. Don’t urge yourself upon me. For the
sake of your innocence and my love, loose me and leave me.”</p>

<p>But confusing sensations dulled the girl to his prayer&mdash;sensations
of vehement rebellion, of incompleteness within
sweet proximity of all, of a vast sadness and vaster joy. She
shook with the shudder that shook him. Her hands drew his
head to a resting place where the robe had fallen from her
breast. She felt him relax in her arms; realized that his
lips had touched, then drawn away from hers, as if offended
by the contact.</p>

<p>“God help me.... More than my honor.”</p>

<p>She scarcely heard his words, so low were they rasped.
The next moment he spoke plainly, although in a hoarse,
hurried voice.</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose made the law that I am trying to
obey? To be born with passions like mine, to hold them in
leash all my life because of the righteous hope my mother
taught me of this moment and you, then to try to convince
myself that it is all a lie for which I have lived&mdash;that love is
less than law&mdash;&mdash; If God Almighty made it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No. Man must have made that law,” the girl interrupted.
“Don’t you feel, John, that love is right? I don’t
know God, but I know you. Can’t you believe that way in
me?”</p>

<p>“<i>Dolores!</i>” With worshipful reproach, he gave her the
vow she asked. “With my mind, my heart, my body I believe
in you. I always shall believe.”</p>

<p>Wonderingly he looked at her lips; saw on them for the
first time a smile. Timidly yet bravely, it rewarded and
further tempted him.</p>

<p>“Then kiss me. Then love me,” she panted. “Oh, I want
so to kiss you&mdash;to love you. I didn’t know how much
until&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A strand of her hair fell across the smiling lips&mdash;across
temptation. Although so tenuous and soft, it was a barrier
between him and that from which he had plead to be saved.
His hand shook from his hurry to brush it aside. The more
greedily for its interference, his lips lowered to those lips
that were tempting him; sank to them; found the complete
answer they had sought in vain to speak.</p>

<p>Dolores’ body was lifted into an embrace which would
have been cruel, except for her desperate response. Her long
hair drifted about them, a curtain from the light. Increasingly
she felt that new sense of incompleteness, that weight
of sadness and lightness of joy. Shaking from the violence
aroused by her yearnings, she yet clung as if to gentleness.</p>

<p>“How strange I feel,” she breathed.</p>

<p>“You are my mate, Dolores.”</p>

<p>Again: “I did not know&mdash;did not understand that love
was like this.”</p>

<p>And again he reassured her: “You are my mate.”</p>

<p>“But is this what they felt for me, those other men? I
hated them for it. I blamed them.”</p>

<p>“No.” He deprived her lips of his that his eyes might
blaze the indignant denial into her eyes. “Their passion was
lust. Yours is the fragrance of the rose&mdash;the pollen of your
love. Do not fear that I could misunderstand.”</p>

<p>“Fear? If God made the rose, why fear?” she half-sobbed.
“If it is not lust for you to love me, give me back
your lips. Oh, kiss me, John. Oh, love me. I <i>belong</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>“I cannot tell more to-night. I cannot make it snappy. I
<i>cannot</i> go on.”</p>

<p>The tortured protest of the spirit-girl Dolores was as the
breath of a blower to her demon audience. It fanned the
tinder of their evil imaginations and inflamed their desires
for intimate details.</p>

<p>A clamor of profanity arose as the marble-pale, but fervid
face which had wrought such grief among men lowered to
the shield of hands that looked too weak to have torn to bits
a strong man’s honor. The shudder of crucified modesty
caused the jewel-like lights that adorned her hair, her throat,
her breast to wink, as from carnal thoughts “indestructible”
as their source of life.</p>

<p>For several nights the first Royal Entertainer had held her
place at the monk-table’s head by virtue of a two-fold charm;
had dazzled their eyes with her beauty and the illusion of her
gorgeous apparel, while enslaving their attention with the
finished style of her tale. Now that she had reached what
might be considered a low spot of intensity, however, her
sense of the artistic had failed her and them. She had fallen
from the superiority of her infernal state; and backslid, as
it were, into the slough of an almost human self-consciousness.
When their most venomous hisses did not lift the sin-dark
head from the board, they turned as one to him who
had arranged the little inside entertainment. Interest of
another kind stirred in them at the look of him.</p>

<p>Exasperation had lifted the King from his chair. He
stood at the table’s foot, glaring down at the proselyte who
had dared to arouse, then deny his emotions. A glow surrounded
him, outlining his superb proportions against the
black velvet hangings. From his eyes&mdash;nearer green than
gray at the moment&mdash;poured a baleful light. His features
worked from mental lasciviousness.</p>

<p>“I told you to dispense with the asterisks,” he reminded
her. “How dare you tease me with this obsolete trick?”</p>

<p>Dolores lifted her face. In the radium glow of his vicious
expectations it gleamed with unthinkable chastity.</p>

<p>“I have not meant to tease or trick you,” she said. “I
have done my best to entertain&mdash;have plotted and planned
my story like the writer of a book&mdash;have rehearsed my lines
each day like an actress before her opening night. Every
little treasured phrase and word I have given you, just as
learned by heart at the time and re-learned in my afterthoughts.
I’ve tried&mdash;<i>tried</i>. But I find that I cannot go on.
No true woman-soul could. What happened was between
ourselves and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Watch your words! For the infidel you boast yourself,
you’re quite too free with the name of a certain Potentate.
Besides, aren’t you flattering the Great-I-Am? I miss my
guess if what happened wasn’t between yourselves and me.”</p>

<p>Dolores’ timidity left her at the suggestion. “I am sure
Your Lowness had nothing to do with&mdash;with that night.
Otherwise it would not seem so wrong to tell it here&mdash;such
an injustice to John. The fault was not his. It was mine&mdash;all
mine. I did what he implored me not to do. I urged
myself upon him beyond his strength. The only excuse for
me is that, with all I had known of mortal man, I really did
not understand. And he&mdash;he had felt so safe in his sorrow.”</p>

<p>Half-rising, she clutched the table for support and gazed
along the double file of spectral faces. The leer on the lips
of him nicknamed Old Original aroused her to further
defense.</p>

<p>“Perhaps our mateship was not meant to be gainsaid.
Perhaps the races of the mortal world would be worthier
their fair lands if right were not made wrong by mortal laws&mdash;if
only the Maker whom John questioned need be obeyed.
Perhaps He meant that the crave to be satisfied of all true
love should compensate for His inexorable law that man
must die.”</p>

<p>At the shriek of derision that greeted her thought, she
lifted her head and eyes in a transport of humble defiance.</p>

<p>“Whatever the perhaps and perhaps, I do not regret. The
proof of what I felt for John I never shall regret. If I
did wrong it was in caring for him and that I could not help.
Love’s first and best impulse is to bestow. I knew that I
belonged to him and I wanted him to know. I am glad&mdash;<i>glad</i>
that I told him. The way I gave the knowledge was
called a crime&mdash;the only crime on earth not judged by motive
and circumstance. Surely on that Day when justice becomes
absolute, I shall not be blamed. What is a whispered
confession, a lingering kiss, an abandoned embrace, to be
quibbled over by Him said to have made us and all that we
are from the impulse of love divine? Did not He Himself
decree that love must be served?”</p>

<p>“She-fiend, you overstep yourself!”</p>

<p>The lash of His Majesty’s voice convinced the girl-soul.
Whipped by it back into her chair, she awaited the chastisement
which probably would follow her regardlessness of
rules. Thoughts of the Wantons’ Well and the Ward for
Bastard Babes subdued her small access of courage in the
dread which had come with her from Earth to Shadow Land.
She closed her eyes; ceased to breathe; expected. The pause
seemed long; was long.</p>

<p>When finally the Rex of Reversals spoke, his humorous
tone and diction made her realize that until then she had
expected clemency.</p>

<p>“Hard to beat, this faith of fools! At least, the Great
Judge of whom you hope a reprieve from the fiat of your
world hasn’t any corner on tolerance. Although love is a
puny motive, I excuse a lot of it for sake of the passion it
begets. Young woman, your story interests me. Since so
large an audience has disconcerted you, suppose you finish
it to sympathetic me alone. It is hate divine that must be
served and you who must serve it.”</p>

<p>Dolores’ moan went unheard in the instant protest of the
demon cabinet. But their controller did not trouble to repeat
his order. Not so much as a gesture or nod of dismissal
did he vouchsafe as they, not daring to vent their spleen over
being excluded from this culminating séance, filed out one
by one.</p>

<p>Although several times before Dolores had been alone
with His Highness, she never had feared as now the Evil
Mind. Her face returned to her palms. In darting speculation
over what he next might say or do, she awaited his
displeasure. Unendurably the silence lasted. She at last
glanced up from morbid curiosity.</p>

<p>He was not looking at her. The green glow, so weird
from his gray eyes, shafted well to one side and past her.
She noticed that he was at once unusually attractive because
unusually repulsive to-night. The concentration into which
he had sunk drew out of her like a magnet a certain sympathy
for the very evil he would do her. She shuddered in
ghoulish anticipation.</p>

<p>More slowly lagged the seconds. More unnatural it
seemed that still he did not look at her. Had there remained
in his mind a shadow of Old Sam’s suggestion that
he had a weakness for her? Doubt of what might lurk in
his averted eyes obsessed her.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you speak? Why don’t you look at me?” she
urged aloud. “Please look at me.”</p>

<p>She would better have remained in doubt. To see what
was in his eyes, to try to grasp the odious meaning of the
glance now fixed upon her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>As she swayed backward in her chair, he proceeded to
enlighten her.</p>

<p>“I get it.”</p>

<p>“<i>It</i>, Your Majesty?”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;you&mdash;the secret power that has made you the desire
of men and devils. Who would have thought to look at you
that it was only a case of lust beget lust?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that!”</p>

<p>He leered. “Why a pretense of apology between two bad
ones like us? Instead of protesting virtues of which you
ought to be ashamed, realize that your guilt as charged makes
your desirability one-hundred-per-cent-plus down here, as
it did on Earth.”</p>

<p>Evidently not interested in her agreement, he turned away
and began to pace the floor.</p>

<p>“This has been a red-letter night to me. Do you know,
you’re not telling a good story&mdash;not good at all. It has
elements that quite hold me. We’ve had the vamp in books,
over the footlights and on the screen. I thought I knew the
types and methods forward and backward&mdash;especially back.
But your delineation of a young girl who is without design
because herself unconscious of the prurience in her, who
appeals to the best in men by her guilelessness and the worst
by her sleeping desire, who, although intending well, spreads
disaster in her wake&mdash;&mdash; No matter what its claims to truth,
sweet Grief, it makes a damned bad story.”</p>

<p>He stopped directly before her in time to hear a murmured
appeal to her guardian companions.</p>

<p>“Innocentia, must I believe these dreadful things about
myself? If they are not true, help me to prove them false,
dear, <i>dear</i> Amor.”</p>

<p>Approvingly the Satanic chuckle sounded. “Consistent
to fanaticism in your part! As you like. But let’s get to
the end. Forget the asterisks. Pull up the curtain. Give
us the expurgated lines.”</p>

<p>“If I am fanatic in my desire to be decent, you are an
atheist. I tell you I cannot&mdash;will not go on!” From strength
of her abhorrence the spirit-girl started up and faced him.
“Punish me as you like. Anything is better than to strip
my soul to your unholy gaze.”</p>

<p>“<i>Anything?</i>” He seized her arm with the sear of a red-hot
iron. “I’ll give you one second to fête your fancy upon
what your punishment might be. You’ll pay in full, you
helliot, if you cheat me of an experiment that I plan to
make. You’ve given me an idea more seducing than any
of my own inception. If it works out, it will net you more
than it will me. Come a day, you being what you are and
I what I am&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wish to hear no new ideas for me. I cannot endure
more to-night.”</p>

<p>At her sustained effort to combat his will he leaned so
close over her that her face felt scorched from his mental
insistence, more offensive than the physical insistence of any
man of Earth. She struggled toward her chair; there fell
face forward on the board. He&mdash;without looking, she saw&mdash;swept
after her like some ravening bird of prey. Strong,
long talons clutched her. Almost had they shaken her access
of strength from her when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Better let up on her, Your Demnition Pow-Wows.”</p>

<p>A carping voice offered the advice. A tall, strong-looking
ghoul swaggered into the light from the comparative darkness
outside the door.</p>

<p>“Sin, you infernal eaves-dropper, how dare you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Leaves-dropper, rather&mdash;table-leaves-dropper.” With incredible
bravado Old Original winked into the Balial glare.
“May I assume the compliment to my invisibility that you
failed to notice me humbly awaiting Your Damnity’s convenience
without?”</p>

<p>“Impudently awaiting My Damnity’s inconvenience, you
mean. You may <i>not</i>. That I didn’t notice you was due to
the super-visibility of our royal <i>raconteuse</i>.”</p>

<p>“Who will recount no more if you continue to torture her.
Having recommended her to your inclemency in the first
place, I feel more than less responsible. The wages of sin
are best paid by death&mdash;you’ll concede that to me, Excellency?
Yet you do not, I am sure, wish her to die.”</p>

<p>“Low-brow, she cannot die.”</p>

<p>The old hoax returned a confident leer. “That I grow
more high-brow with every age let me demonstrate through
a reminder of how the greatest roughness is the gentlest.
What diverts you in her&mdash;her very virile hope&mdash;may die
before that Day. Am I right or wrong in saying that you
owe me, if not her, some consideration?”</p>

<p>“Wrong you are. You did throw me the acorn from which
a giant oak may grow.”</p>

<p>“And hasn’t she sirened you along bad and improper?
Hasn’t she been square with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s been square. There wasn’t a right angle to
all the past Delilahs ever damned by man or me.”</p>

<p>Sin, with a wary eye fixed upon the Master of Malice,
made for that end of the monk-board nearer the exit. The
while he further ventured: “It isn’t necessarily lowering
to Your Highness to say that you have more to learn than
I anent the siren act. You can’t bully a dame into doting on
you. The present-day caveman style is 40 H. P.&mdash;<i>after</i>
you’ve got her. Before, a wise one coaxes her. And it isn’t
enough to load her down with that stage jewelry of which
you’re so prodigal, when you yourself don’t look to be, any
more than you act to be, of her day and degeneration. Why
not tog yourself up more in the likeness of this millionaire
love-hound of hers? Summertime’s coming apace or I’m
no weather prophet, so why not moth-ball the well-known
Vandyke and those robes of the vintage of Sol-in-all-his-glory
days?”</p>

<p>A snarl of stabbed vanity greeted the daring suggestion.
Its cogency was demonstrated, however, when, in a lunge
after the purveyor of unsolicited counsel, the King tripped
over his train.</p>

<p>From the hall the minister primed his advices.</p>

<p>“As for your technique, soft-pedal yourself. Don’t keep
blaring like a brass band at a lady who has fainted with fear
of your noise.”</p>

<p>The slam of the door was the old impertinent’s period.</p>

<p>Once more tormentor and tormented were alone. Slowly
the Past-Master of Policy righted himself and his intent. Returning
to the prostrate girl-shade, he thinkingly regarded
her. Her side face lay lax upon the board, exquisite as an
irradiated cameo in its twisted setting of hair. Closed were
those eyes of the purples of the bourgainvillae. Not a
breath lifted the luring lines of the back revealed by her
<i>décolleté</i>. Could her spirit really have swooned beyond his
reach?</p>

<p>He shrugged away the thought. Too often and too vehemently
had he himself longed for surcease from consciousness
in the last ten thousand years or so. Too well he knew
that she still could hear him. Through time which had no beginning
and could not end, she as well as he must continue
to think&mdash;and think&mdash;and think.</p>

<p>Thinking of her now as he looked, he felt more than before
attracted toward that new idea regarding her which
had been inspired by the latest chapter of her earth history.
The oldest Original was right. His ways with women were
archaic as his clothes in the sight of this most modern of
Magdalenes. No repression of his ruthlessness or change in
his “style” would be too great a price to pay for success in
that experiment.</p>

<p>When he spoke it was in mild tones.</p>

<p>“Forgive my stupidity. ‘It ain’t inherited&mdash;it’s a gift.’ All
right, fairest fiend. We’ll call it a séance to-night. Or
better, suppose I give you a lift over the scene which has
overwhelmed you with self-consciousness. At that, it may
affect me worse to tell it myself. They say the narrator
gets more out of his story than his hearers. He first must
feel to arouse feeling. A good bad idea. So then, <i>I’ll</i> tell
<i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>The tips of his fingers crackled as he touched them to his
lips, then waved them toward the unresponsive audience.</p>

<p>“Behind the Asterisks!” he announced his subject. “The
Great-I-Am invented the sex-impulse in order to give life
to love. Necessarily He had to make it a strong emotion in
order to people His earth.</p>

<p>“I invented loveless lust to people Hell. None born of
the flesh dares deny his vulnerability. None but feels its
basic attraction, even at times when most repulsed. Not to its
cruder phases do I invite your attention&mdash;to the reproductive
instinct of the mortal male. That is ever awake, unashamed,
engaging chiefly through its strength.</p>

<p>“But sleeping passion! Too few are given the dear delight
of arousing it. To breathe open the eyes searching through
their mist of dreams&mdash;to kiss into consciousness the sweet-thick
lips&mdash;to feel one’s sluggish pulse speeding to match the
beat of youth’s startled heart&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ah, what man-brute of Earth, what god of Heaven or
fiend of Hell would not gladly give the wealth of three
worlds to incite the divine awakening!</p>

<p>The works of the old Cabot clock were worn out. During
the days and nights that followed its last tick Dolores
often glanced up into its non-committal face, reproachful
that it would no longer mark off the minutes. Time dragged,
weighted by her doubt over the state of mind of John.</p>

<p>Then, one night after twelve, when all the household was
asleep, he came back to her. He folded her against his heart.
He took her lips. He claimed her with full acknowledgment
of his dependency.</p>

<p>“God forgive me,” he said. “It is too much for me.”</p>

<p>There was no need for him to explain. His white face,
the pound of his heart against hers, his inconsistent pleas
for pardon that he might be free to sin again, all helped
her to understand. He was possessed by the passion of
an all-demanding love. He had fought a fight; had fought
and had failed.</p>

<p>And Dolores could not lament his defeat. Only one thing
mattered, that John’s love answered hers. She had called
and he had heard. Against his will he had come. Their
acknowledgment, then, had not been a regrettable impulse;
had been, rather, what was to be. They loved, and Heaven
was in their hearts. They <i>loved</i>.</p>

<p>After the days of doubt, Dolores rested in blessed conviction.
Never before had she been given a chance at happiness.
Here was her chance. Suggestions of smiles formed
about her lips. A new light, like the gleam from deep-cut
amethysts, shone from her eyes. A man like John Cabot
did not love lightly. And John Cabot loved her.</p>

<p>Next morning she awoke with the wish that her father
might know how well all was with her. Although a drizzling
rain began to fall, she decided against ordering Jack’s car.
She preferred to go to Trevor Trent simply, as they had
lived, changed only by the glory from within. She felt close
to him while donning, for the first time in weeks, the old
blue serge suit whose purchase price he had spared from
the poppy paste. The long ride up-town in the Subway, the
mudded walk and the plain slab that marked the spot where
she had left him to lie beneath down-drifting leaves, brought
her nearer.</p>

<p>Where is there comfort like confiding a rapturous secret
to one’s own? How long the orphaned girl sat beside the
grave, oblivious of the rain because her consciousness had
gone to find and gladden that of the parent whose last
“please God” had been that she find a good love&mdash;how
drenched was the blue suit&mdash;how chilled her feet&mdash;she subtracted
none of her attention from him to realize. The adventure
brought her content.</p>

<p>Sometime during the afternoon she returned to the great
house on the upper Avenue. So dulled she felt to outer
perceptions that surprise held her only a moment to meet
the Frenchwoman, Annette, in the elevator. She somehow
forgot to listen to the maid’s explanation of why she had
not remained with madame. Later she was forced to hear
Morrison’s insistence that she needed a doctor, but made
light of the good woman’s anxiety. What mattered a slight
fever or swollen tonsils or a disinclination toward food to
one blessed as was she?</p>

<p>As developed, however, these symptoms mattered much
in the heightening of her happiness. The housekeeper’s responsibility,
transferred to Bradish, resulted in a telephoned
message to Mr. Cabot’s club. Soon after the wire, he came,
terrified out of all proportion to her trifling symptoms. To
see that all his instructions were carried out, he stayed.</p>

<p>Dolores’ protestations soon ceased, since to relieve his
anxiety might take him away again. It was too precious
to forego, this experience of being ministered to by him.
Their first meal alone together, which he ordered served in
Jack’s living room much as the youngster himself might
have done, was an occasion almost too significant for calm.
To please him, she tried to sip her broth and eat her toast,
but with the sacred joy of a convert at some sacrament.</p>

<p>After he had shut out the servants and advised Morrison
that he would sit awhile with Miss Trent, he wrapped her
first in a robe, then in his arms and sat rocking her with a
possessive tenderness which made her realize how much she
had missed from her babyhood. Her ecstasy of content
must have dulled her ears. She heard no sound, merely
assumed one, when he placed her in Jack’s reading chair,
took a few steps toward the hall door and stood intently
listening. Still she had heard nothing when he strode to
the door and flung it wide.</p>

<p>Upon the threshold, in a panic of indecision between flight
and remaining, stood Annette. Her eyes, nondescript except
for their shrewdness, followed the thinking glance of the
man who had surprised her from the half-light of the corridor
to the strong one of the reading-lamp within, then down
to the key-hole, minus its key. Evidently, she decided on
bravado. A sneer drew down the corners of her mouth.
She straightened to face the master.</p>

<p>“You back?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Madame finds herself in need of certain dinner gowns.
She returned me to select and pack them.”</p>

<p>“She sent you back from Florida to select and pack certain
dinner gowns? Just what does madame pay you for the
job?”</p>

<p>“Does not Mr. Cabot know the amount of my salary, none
too large for one who has served&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I mean how much for this key-hole job?”</p>

<p>At his contemptuous interruption, the woman caught her
breath.</p>

<p>“Five-hundred-dollar, m’sieu.”</p>

<p>“A five-hundred-dollar bonus? Madame is good to you.
However, I am in a position to be better. I’ll advance that
bonus to-night, if you’ll leave her employ.”</p>

<p>Her avaricious watch of his face eased in a disappointed
laugh. “Does m’sieu think I would turn the traitor to
a mistress who has ever been most generous and who
trusts&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“And for a wretched five hundred, already earned?”</p>

<p>“I do not&mdash;not for five hundred.” He contributed a short
laugh. “But for that in cash, plus a check for one thousand,
good in six months if you neglect to report to this trusting
mistress who has been so generous with you.”</p>

<p>“But how can M’sieu Cabot think so low of me that for a
paltry thousand-dollar&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The five hundred you get now,” he detailed. “The check
for a thousand will be dated so that you can cash it in June,
unless traitoring has become a habit with you. If it does,
I shall stop payment at the bank. You will leave this house
and Mrs. Cabot’s employ at once. Satisfactory?”</p>

<p>The click of the last-word question must have satisfied the
maid that she could profit no further.</p>

<p>“Quite,” she replied, succinctly as he.</p>

<p>Without comment on the fact that he had read her aright,
John Cabot counted five century notes from his wallet and
drew the promised check, calling her attention to the date,
six months from that day.</p>

<p>When she had gone he said to Dolores:</p>

<p>“I want my freedom, but not at your expense.”</p>

<p>“You really think,” the girl faltered, “that that is why
Annette is here?”</p>

<p>He nodded. “And why you are here and why I should not
be. I have been inexcusable. <i>I</i> am the traitor&mdash;the waster
of what I valued most.”</p>

<p>“Don’t keep saying that,” she protested. “Nothing can be
wasted when we love. Jack lived and died that we might
know.”</p>

<p>Through the gloom of self-reproach which was settling
over him&mdash;settling between them&mdash;he saw her outstretched
hands; caught them; was reminded of her feverish state.</p>

<p>“Dear, it will come right,” he made effort to assure her
and, with her, himself. “We mustn’t allow anything to be
wasted, not a moment of our time together, not a regret for
the innocence which I should have died rather than&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her smile stopped him&mdash;the shy, tremulous, revealing
smile so lately learned. Had a dew-wet violet along a woodland
path looked up at him, he could not have trod upon it.
He must not tread upon that smile.</p>

<p>He returned to his delightful care of her. His first and
most important obligation was to see that she did not become
ill, he told her. She must rest now; must sleep off her temperature.
He rang for Mrs. Morrison; agreed that their
charge might be put to bed in Jack’s four-poster; himself
suggested that the Airedale be allowed upstairs to snuggle at
her feet. And when the housekeeper had finished her
motherly offices, he made her no explanation of why he still
sat reading in the outer room.</p>

<p>Not since the slight ailments to which all children are heir
had Dolores been ill. Shivering into the eider-down of the
historic bed, she felt vaguely wretched, uncertain, lost.
From the same impulse which had asked the reward of a
good-night kiss from Morrison for her tractability, she now
asked John:</p>

<p>“You won’t go away?”</p>

<p>“Leave the corridor door ajar, Morrison.” As if from
afar she heard his instructions. “Come up again when it is
time for her medicine. And, Morrison, I have discharged
Mrs. Cabot’s maid. She is to leave as soon as she can pack
her things.”</p>

<p>Dolores grew warmer, then uncomfortably warm. She
must soon have fallen into a doze. When she opened her
eyes, she saw that the night lamp had been clicked off and
the light from the living-room shaded from her face by a
screen. The four, tall, pineapple sentinels guarded her&mdash;they
and someone else.</p>

<p>John sat beside the bed, the puppy drowsing in his arms.
She was glad that he had become reconciled to the poor little
beast; that the guiltless cause of Jack’s death was not to pay
the price which she had paid in early life for an equally
unintentional fault.</p>

<p>But <i>was</i> John reconciled?</p>

<p>The look on his face brought her to acute consciousness.
It was a dreadful look.</p>

<p>“Try not to begrudge the price,” she murmured. “For
the least thing in life you have to pay, you know. To me,
love is inestimable.”</p>

<p>At sound of her voice the young dog lifted one of his
scraggly eyelids, and, without otherwise moving, thumped
his stub of a tail. John’s expression changed. He leaned
toward her.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t regret any price that I myself could pay. But
I am not satisfied to let you, who can’t afford it, pay for me.
And I won’t.”</p>

<p>She did not understand just what he meant. “You talk
as though you were guilty of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He caught her hand and pressed his cheek against it.</p>

<p>“Guilty as&mdash;Heaven!” he whispered into its palm before
replacing it beneath the coverlet. At her disturbed look he
added: “I am tired with anxiety for you. Won’t you sleep
to rest me? Don’t be afraid that I am going to leave you.
I can stay on this watch of love forever, if only you will
sleep.”</p>

<p>“John&mdash;John?” Vaguely she questioned him.</p>

<p>“You are my mate,” he answered. “Rufus called you a
gray dove, but to me you are pure white. Fold your wings
and sleep.”</p>

<p>“And are you happy, John?”</p>

<p>“Happy as&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her eyelids closed at the touch of his lips. Happy as
who? She wondered. Happy as Cain&mdash;that was the meaning
of the dreadful look she had surprised. But she had
banished that look. Since she must sleep that his mind might
rest&mdash;&mdash; How wonderful was this state called happiness.
How precious was each small opportunity to prove how very
much&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Fold your wings, my white dove,” he murmured again
and again. “Sleep, my mate. I love you. Sleep.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A hysterical yelp awakened her. Evidently the Airedale,
too, had been startled from sound slumber. How long had
she been asleep&mdash;for how many minutes or hours had John
Cabot sat there motionless, his eyes on her face?</p>

<p>She raised on one elbow and looked into the outer room.
The little undergraduate from the A. K. C., more from
hereditary instinct than any wisdom of his own months, had
bolted his bed of honor. One backward glare he spared to
learn whether he was to be justified in raising the alarm;
then, bristling from stiff chin whiskers to flag-staff tail,
rushed into the corridor. His master followed.</p>

<p>Dolores tried hard to understand. Her head felt strange
and understanding hurt it. Many sentences of the colloquy
outside were not clear at the time, but came back to her
afterward. Besides the voice of John Cabot, she recognized
the distressed <i>mezzo</i> of Morrison, the startled quaver of old
Bradish and an unrecognized duet in bass.</p>

<p>“We are all of that, Mr. Cabot&mdash;from the Domestic Detectives,
Incorporated,” sounded the first strange voice, evidently
in answer to some question or comment from John.</p>

<p>“And just in time, at that”&mdash;the second.</p>

<p>“Has Annette gone yet, Morrison?”</p>

<p>Bradish answered John’s question. “I let her out not ten
minutes ago, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you see her speak to these men?”</p>

<p>“She did not pass near enough to speak to them, sir. But
I think she signaled them with a gesture. I cannot be sure.”</p>

<p>One of the strangers interrupted. “You can’t deny that
Miss Trent is inside.”</p>

<p>“I deny nothing, but I do order you out of my house,”
John returned.</p>

<p>“Don’t you owe it to yourself to explain, Mr. Cabot?”
asked Morrison. “I’ve worked in this family all my life and
am considered a proper woman. The young lady you ask
about is seriously ill. Mr. Cabot is here because my father,
the butler, telephoned for him.”</p>

<p>“Ill, is she?”&mdash;the first strange voice. “Well, we’re
specialists sent to investigate her symptoms. Here, matey,
help me ease this gent away from the door. No need for
strenuous argument when we’re two to his one.”</p>

<p>“Look out&mdash;a gun!”&mdash;the second.</p>

<p>“And a gun,” John added quietly, “trained to put burglars
out of my house.”</p>

<p>“We’re not burglars, Cabot. We’re authorized to enter
by the lady of your house.”</p>

<p>“By Mrs. Cabot? Her authorization can’t help you&mdash;from
the distance of Palm Beach.”</p>

<p>Together the two laughed. One explained their amusement.</p>

<p>“Wifie isn’t in Palm Beach, old chap. She’s waiting down
at the Plaza to give us any further authority we need over
the telephone.”</p>

<p>“She&mdash;didn’t&mdash;go?”</p>

<p>A moment of silence followed John’s slow question; then,
in staccato&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, get your further authority over an outside ’phone.
Mine are busy. Quick, now&mdash;my fingers are nervous. I’d
be well within my rights if I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A grumbled sentence which Dolores could not hear ended
in steps descending the stairs. The colloquy seemed to be
ended. She felt relieved; dozed off.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The morning was half over before John enquired about
her condition over Jack’s telephone. He felt that he must
tell her certain facts, not so much to worry her as to spare
her worry over matters which undoubtedly soon would be
forced upon her attention. He hoped that listening would
not tax her, since the physician’s morning report had been
most encouraging. A little patience, a few days within
doors, and she would be herself again. His relief she could
better imagine than he describe.</p>

<p>If his friend Rufus Holt called to see her, she was to talk
to him as she felt inclined and might trust his advices.
Toward any other inquiries regarding her personal affairs
she should not commit herself. For some time he would
not be able to see her and considered it best that he should
get his news of her through Morrison. She must take all
possible care of herself and believe that nothing&mdash;<i>nothing</i>
had been wasted.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Dolores hung up the receiver, scarcely had
given her mind to the realization that John Cabot was trying
to protect her from whatever it was that threatened, when
the gallery door opened and Clarke Shayle strode into the
room.</p>

<p>He looked flushed, hurried, perturbed. He stopped before
Jack’s reading chair, in which she sat, and fixed his odd-flecked
gaze upon her, his lips twitching. Sinking on the
hassock, he laid his face in the robe that wrapped her knees
and drew a rasping, relieved sigh.</p>

<p>“I was a fool to credit a word of it,” he exclaimed
brokenly. “You really are sick. You really are&mdash;are everything
I believed. I don’t care what she says or what anybody
says. I wouldn’t care even if they could prove it.
What a man thinks himself is the only thing that matters.
And I’ve got a sort of super-think.” His attempt to banish
emotion from his face with a grin was more ghastly than
gay. “You see, it ain’t inherited. It’s a gift.”</p>

<p>Even in this crisis, he could not express himself without
the use of his banal phrases. Dolores felt sorry for him.
She stretched out her hand from an impulse to smooth back
his stiff, auburn cowlick; then, remembering, drew it back.</p>

<p>“What ‘she’ and what ‘anybody’ says?” she asked.</p>

<p>“She sent for me this morning and told me all about last
night. I believe she had the whole thing planned from first
sight of you. She’s the only wholly bad woman I’ve ever
known&mdash;Catherine.” He shaded his eyes as if confused by
her shocked glance, then continued: “She loves herself and
hates everyone who does not share the feeling, chiefly her
husband. Because he has humiliated her by getting her number
right, she intends to humiliate him before their world.
She’s going to marry d’Elie after she gets all she wants out
of Cabot and gets it her own way. As for me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His face lowered into his freckled, delicate hands. A
shudder moved his thick neck and muscular back.</p>

<p>“God knows, I deserve the part she’s cast me for. But I
pray Him&mdash;I pray you to let me off. My self-respect was
only doped. It came to the day I met you and has made me
so unhappy since that I&mdash;I hope&mdash;&mdash; Oh, have a heart, little
chump! Help me to be honest with you&mdash;encourage me to
explain.”</p>

<p>“Why? Why not?” She hesitated.</p>

<p>“<i>Why?</i> Because I owe it to you to make you understand.
<i>Why not?</i> Because you have made me despise myself and
my life. Here in your presence, at the present moment, I’d
rather die than go on. And yet, I’ll worse than die if I
don’t go on. Dolores, you have felt something of my power&mdash;you
know that I’m mesmeric and hypnotic. You know
that I know it, but not that I have used it to make me what
I am to-day.” He gave a limping laugh. “Can’t you imagine
what is my professional stock-in-trade&mdash;how I hold Catherine
and her sort in scented boudoirs?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;<i>no</i>.” With her low protest, the girl drew back into
her chair; clutched its arms; closed her eyes, as if against
the perception.</p>

<p>From his abject position at her feet, the young man
straightened and clasped together his hands so viciously that
nails cut into flesh. The white spots pressed by his teeth
into his lower lip spread backward until even his ears were
pale.</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of it,” he said effortfully. “The best
is that I could have roused you, could rouse you now. But
I won’t. I know the tinder you are made of. That first
day I realized that my self-respect was only auto-hypnotized,
not dead. The feeling for you that restrained me has grown&mdash;has
given me the strength to tell you the truth and ask
your help.”</p>

<p>“But if you despise yourself and your life,” Dolores faltered,
“why not help yourself?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that a bad habit soon masters one? The
damnable thing has got me, that’s why. It will take something
stronger than contempt for myself to get me out. That
something is my respect for you. The fact that I didn’t&mdash;that
I simply couldn’t&mdash;&mdash;” His fingers forward-stretching,
but clutching only air, his face again florid from a return
rush of blood, he urged: “You&mdash;I need <i>you</i>. God,
I am mad for you. Have been all along. But I want you
to keep. I want you enough to change my whole life to
have you. I know I am a crude sort&mdash;that I’m not what
they call to the manner born. But I swear to give you a
square deal. I don’t care what they say about you. I believe
in you. I want to marry you&mdash;to take you off somewhere,
so that you and I&mdash;&mdash; Surely you love me, Dolores?
Surely you will&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The pause was long. During it he seized her limp hand,
then dropped it. He staggered to his feet and stood looking
down at her with the dread gaze of despair. When he spoke
again, his lips worked clumsily.</p>

<p>“So. I’m too late. You’re a snuffed candle to me. That
means&mdash;Mr. Other Man. The reward of my sacrifice is&mdash;punishment.
It’s a beautiful sentiment. I’ll tell the world
that. She was speaking the truth for once, then, about you
and John Cabot? All right. I quit. I’m through.”</p>

<p>Dolores watched him fling into his overcoat, pick up his
hat and start for the door. She wished to say something that
would help him. She owed him consideration as the only
man who had asked her to marry him. That he had asked
her soothed an ache in her mind. She liked him and she
feared for him. But what was there she could say?</p>

<p>Without a word she had refused him. Without a word
she let him go.</p>

<p>The American vernacular “breezed in” might have been
inspired by the entries of Rufus Holt. Less boisterous than
a gale, stronger than a zephyr, something refreshing and
promising came with him, like the tonic in the breath of
Spring.</p>

<p>“Glad you’re enjoying a rest,” he saluted Dolores. “You
need it, probably, as much as you deserve it. Or perhaps I
should say you deserve it as much as you need it. It is a
worthy thought, for it works both ways.”</p>

<p>The girl, having been foreadvised to trust the attorney,
relaxed in his balmy friendliness.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t the truth usually work both ways?”</p>

<p>At her offering he rubbed his bald fore-top. “I don’t
know about that. We lawyers learn not to expect too much
of the truth. It has gone some if it works one way.”</p>

<p>The fact that he would not take off his top-coat gave each
minute of the time that he did stay an added value. That
he would not smoke somehow increased the fragrance about
him of a fine cigar. That he gave her choice of chairs for
him the preference lent companionableness to his manner of
pulling up directly before her.</p>

<p>“The future has in it lots and lots of trouble that hasn’t
been used yet,” he prefaced, suddenly grave, “and don’t think
that you, lovely little lady, are going to get all of it. There
are other non-union workers besides yourself.”</p>

<p>“Others?”</p>

<p>He evaded the question direct.</p>

<p>Trouble was the text of his small address&mdash;trouble ahead
of a kind she had not known. She must prepare her mind
for it; must gather her resources against an attack. And
another would be protected in the protectorate of herself,
one who deserved justification quite as much as she.</p>

<p>Meeting the silent, fluent appeal of her eyes, he set aside
hyperbole; before her placed facts, as if on the salver of
his outspread hands.</p>

<p>Catherine Cabot was an edition of womankind which
Dolores doubtless had found hard to read. Velvet-bound
was she, gilt-edged, artfully illustrated. The most astute
of worldlings might remain unenlightened for many chapters
as to the plot of her. Spite, it would seem, was her
motivation&mdash;spite toward a husband who had depreciated
what she was by a deliberate and stubborn over-valuation.</p>

<p>Long she had waited and watched to prove the plot of
him as bad as her own. Quite recently she had refused a
separation because she wished, not only a divorce, but a discredited
husband and a huge, decreed alimony, rather than a
collusive settlement. Her engagement of Dolores, her
pseudo-kindnesses, her pretended dependence upon the girl
in her recent trip South&mdash;a trip that had taken her no farther
than Philadelphia and been followed by a secret return to
a mid-town hotel&mdash;were calculated steps toward this end.
To-day she had served upon her husband the complaint in a
suit for absolute divorce. Dolores Trent, grief now to one
woman as to many men, she had named as co-respondent.</p>

<p>The dread announcement was made.</p>

<p>Forgetting the hurry on account of which he had refused
to smoke, Holt now busied himself producing a cigar, clipping
it and lighting it. Through smoke-clouds he looked
across at the notorious girl whom he had whip-lashed with
news of fresh notoriety. Seeing that her lips moved, he
leaned forward to catch her words.</p>

<p>“Maybe she was not so bad as&mdash;&mdash; The idea was d’Elie’s.
I mustn’t forget that. <i>He</i> suggested that the father of
<i>l’enfant terrible</i> might find me congenial&mdash;not she. ‘Enough,
my clever Henri. I understand.’ I remember distinctly
what she said.”</p>

<p>In the midst of her shared memories, she became conscious
of the quality of the lawyer’s regard. Her eyes lifted
to his.</p>

<p>“You believe that I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Perhaps the more staunchly for catching the sag in her
voice, he sought to reassure her. “I <i>know</i> that you are
guiltless. Do you recall the little toast I gave you one night
at dinner? I didn’t say on that occasion that I’d been doubly
favored by meeting your kind of a woman twice in my lifetime&mdash;the
woman who doesn’t need to boast or sparkle or
promise&mdash;the woman who needs only to be. The first one,
Miss Trent, of whom you reminded me, was my mother.”</p>

<p>Dolores was startled. Always before she had suffered because
unjustly blamed. Now she was unjustly praised. She
did not feel honest. But she must be careful, even with
the kindly attorney. She had John, as well as herself, to
think of. The fault was not so much his as hers and he
must not be blamed.</p>

<p>“Then, too&mdash;&mdash;” Holt had cleared the huskiness from his
throat&mdash;“I know John Cabot.”</p>

<p>Evidently that, to him, was conclusive.</p>

<p>By and by he added: “Even Mrs. Cabot does not think
you guilty, as she charges.”</p>

<p>“How can you know that?” Again Dolores was startled.</p>

<p>“She admitted as much to me not more than an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“You have talked with her to-day and she admitted&mdash;&mdash; Then,
perhaps, she <i>can</i> be reached?”</p>

<p>But the bald head wagged, even as the friendly eyes
beamed upon her. “She cannot be reached as you mean,
although I have reached her in a way for which you may
despise me. Mrs. Cabot has retained me as her lawyer in
this case.”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;her lawyer?” The words were so hot, they seemed
to scorch Dolores’ lips. “I thought you were his friend?”</p>

<p>“I am. But Catherine believes now that I have always
cared&mdash;for her, you know&mdash;and that therefore I want her
freedom more than anything else in the world. A vain
woman can easily be persuaded of that.”</p>

<p>Dolores could not understand. “You say you really are
his friend, yet you take Mrs. Cabot’s case against him?
What possible motive&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Me, too, you do an injustice, Miss Trent.”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;too?”</p>

<p>“Even me. I am taking the case to lose it.”</p>

</div>

<p>Before the divorce suit of Cabot vs. Cabot came to trial
reassurance on several of its vital points reached Dolores
through the consideration of Rufus Holt. To the greatest
possible extent details were to be denied the scandal-hungry
public. John Cabot would offer his defense through eminent
counsel, as a case unworthy his personal appearance. She
herself, the co-respondent so necessary to the severance of
marital ties if one lives and sues in the Empire commonwealth,
was to remain for the present with Mrs. Morrison,
reported as too ill to undertake the vindication of her name.
Roscoe Strang, the judge who was to pass upon the Cabot
difference, was a friend of Holt’s, indebted to him for many
favors, political and otherwise. The small attorney had seen
to that. Soon everything would be settled, as Mrs. Cabot’s
case would be advanced on the calendar on her plea that she
wished to have the painful affair over as soon as possible
that she might hasten abroad to undertake certain war-orphan
charities to which she had pledged herself in loving
memory of her little son.</p>

<p>Despite all these assurances, the girl awaited with keen
anxiety a call to a special conference with the plaintiff’s
lawyer for which she had been told to hold herself in readiness
immediately after the public hearing. Summoned one
mid-February afternoon by special messenger, she taxied
according to instructions to a down-town “square” not far
from the City Hall Park that housed the courts of alleged
justice.</p>

<p>One glance at Rufus Holt through the folds of the veil
she had been asked to wear convinced her that this, indeed,
was his first detour from straight legal paths. Although he
smiled in at her from the opened cab door, much of the
cheer and most of the youth was gone from his face. After
giving a low-voiced address to the driver, he seated himself
beside her and forced a return to his wonted sanguineness.</p>

<p>No need for Dolores to ask in words whether the ordeal
was over&mdash;whether John Cabot had been vindicated of the
charge. The moment their machine was underway, her eyes
put the demand.</p>

<p>“Judge Strang reserved decision. But they always do
that, as I explained a short while since to my client,” answered
Holt. “You and I are going now to meet a friend
of mine&mdash;just that, a friend of mine. In the course of a day
or so, the case will be decided&mdash;against me.”</p>

<p>Under all the circumstances, his sigh was justifiable.
Dolores was beginning to realize that. The change in his
face alone told her the enormity of his sacrifice in laying
professional honor upon the altar of a man-to-man friendship.
As the taxi wound its way up-town, he gave her an
idea of the proceedings.</p>

<p>The beautiful Mrs. Cabot, an appealing picture in her
sables and crepe, had been, of course, her own chief witness.
She had told of her tried determination to believe in her
husband and the girl whom she had sheltered from storm-blasts
which had seemed driving her to an unthinkable fate.
She had been slow&mdash;too slow to admit that any form so
young and fair could house such veteran vices.</p>

<p>In broken sentences, as if warding off an emotional breakdown,
she had outlined the hold which the governess had
won upon her own heart through the heart of her only child.
Not until after the boy’s death had she brought herself to
consider the suggestions of servants and friends that all was
not well within her household. When the doctors had prescribed
a change of climate for her, she had pretended to go
South, but with the idea of returning at once in order to
determine the truth for herself. Her maid, a French woman
in whom she had felt all confidence, she had sent on an
errand back to the house to learn late developments. While
Annette was still within, her detectives had followed her
husband there. This maid evidently had been over-bribed,
for, after signaling the detectives that the moment was propitious
to enter, she had disappeared. That fact was stronger
than any report could have been as evidence against Mr.
Cabot.</p>

<p>All that she felt she needed to add to the testimony of
the detectives was the name of the Circe who had destroyed
the good-faith of her home. Would New York be surprised
to hear this new chapter in the unparalleled career of one
already known as “Grief to Men”?</p>

<p>“You let her name me in open court?” Dolores covered
her veiled face with her hands.</p>

<p>“What did it matter when you had been named in the
legal papers?” the attorney reminded her. “I was able,
however, to check her further attempts to pay her respects
to you by insisting that she need not distress herself.”</p>

<p>“And the&mdash;the defense?”</p>

<p>“John had no defense that could be made in such a proceeding.
His attorney’s declaration that Mr. Cabot had
nothing which he cared to offer in the way of testimony may
have convinced the crowd that you were being used, either
with or without your consent, to lift his yoke, but it clearly
puzzled the judge. Before we reach our destination, Miss
Trent, I want to express something of the high esteem in
which I hold you. Oh, don’t draw back&mdash;don’t look so
frightened! This is no declaration in the ordinary sense.”</p>

<p>Removing his hat, he rubbed his egg-white forehead as
though it were a vocabulary from which words might be
extracted by friction.</p>

<p>“Never have I been in the plight called ‘love’&mdash;never expect
to be,” he continued. “In any case, never shall I marry.
Maybe because I thought so much of that mother o’ mine.
Maybe because I think so little of marriage. Can you see
humor in the statement that women, while my professional
specialty, are not at all in my line personally? That fact
may help you to appreciate what I want to say to you.”</p>

<p>He turned toward her with the combination of wistfulness
and whimsicality in his smile which first had attracted
and then animated the lonely girl.</p>

<p>“Miss Trent,” said he, “I think you are the truest woman
I ever have met. I am obsessed by the thought of you. Oh,
not you, really; rather the idea you represent&mdash;the idea of
absolute truth. A woman like you should not fear the
opinion of anyone. Will you remember that&mdash;say, when lifting
your eyes to those of the very next person you meet?”</p>

<p>Dolores assured him that she would. At the same time,
in her thoughts, she assured herself. Just as the primary
appetence common to all animal life is the right to live, the
second appetence common to women is the right to love.
She was not ashamed of her love when facing that inner
tribunal called Truth. Why, indeed, should she fear the
opinion of any man? Rufus Holt, despite the conventional
limitations of his “ideas” of her, was right. She would not,
<i>could</i> not feel ashamed.</p>

<p>To a place no more official than the bachelor apartments
of Justice Roscoe Strang did Rufus Holt dare take the girl
who was not his client. And when a Japanese man-servant
had ushered them both into the somewhat sombre anteroom,
he passed on into a library, but left the door behind him
ajar, evidently that she might overhear his conversation with
his friend.</p>

<p>“You, Rufus?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Roscoe, and about that case I tried before you this
morning&mdash;the Cabot divorce. I’m afraid that a wrong is
being done.”</p>

<p>A bass chortle sounded. “That’s what modern marriage
is&mdash;doing each other wrong.”</p>

<p>“But this is a wrong gone wrong in that it does not strike
right. I have the Cabot co-respondent outside. I want you
to meet her.”</p>

<p>“Not the Trent girl?” The scrape of a chair underscored
a muttered oath. “You don’t dare presume on our
friendship to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not to commit a professional breach, no,” interrupted
Holt. “You ought to know me better than that. And don’t
call her ‘the Trent girl.’ No matter whose lawyer I am, I
tell you that she does not deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t she take the stand? It always looks
bad for a woman when she won’t fight for her good name.
And why wouldn’t this great philanthropist friend of yours
say a word for her, not to mention himself?”</p>

<p>“John Cabot is too big a man to be dragged into a court
defense of the sort. And any man who hopes to meet his
mother’s questioning eyes in Paradise would hesitate to
crucify this girl with any more vulgar notoriety. Roscoe,
for once in my life, the man in me has convinced the lawyer.
Now, as never before, I want the scales of the blind goddess
to weigh <i>with justice</i>.”</p>

<p>“It would seem that one latter-day goddess must have been
already weighed&mdash;and with justice&mdash;to have made such
gooseberry jam out of your heart of flint. A face that can
make <i>you</i> forget to be a lawyer first! I’d like to see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Before “the friend” whom Holt wished her to meet could
retract or modify, Dolores was led into the larger room.
She found that “that very next person” to whose eyes she
would lift her own was the judge of the case of Cabot vs.
Cabot. And while she did not remember&mdash;not exactly&mdash;the
compliment paid her in the cab, she met his shrewd gaze
with her own defense. He looked for the truth. He saw it&mdash;that
she felt no shame.</p>

<p>What they said did not matter&mdash;probably could not have
been recalled by any of the three. Their brief chat was significant
only through the things they might not say.</p>

<p>In Justice Strang Dolores saw a man who filled her with
confidence. The determination to know the worst about
himself and conquer it showed in the set of his jaw. His
red necktie had action&mdash;even daring. His attire otherwise,
like his manner, was conventional.</p>

<p>He escorted them into the hall and to the elevator. Just
before the door clicked shut upon them he said so emphatically
that the elevator-man turned and stared curiously at
her:</p>

<p>“Young lady, you have the most eloquent personality I
have ever met.”</p>

<p>And so it came about that the decision denying Catherine
Cabot her divorce came to the press as a thunder-clap two
days later. The comment that resulted Justice Strang met
with interviews in which he put unanswerable questions.
Who suffered most, the innocent or the guilty? To make
the innocent suffer&mdash;was not that a culpable act? What
had been proved? The wife’s evidence was unavailable.
The maid had disappeared. The detectives could testify to
nothing that was proof of guilt. Why elect a judicial
puppet? Of what use was a judge not entitled to disregard
everything except his own honest opinion?</p>

<p>Thus it transpired that Dolores Trent, having been convicted
unjustly in the public mind of the several past offenses
ascribed to her, found herself vindicated of the one crime
against Society of which she really was guilty as charged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Each morning a magnificent box from an Avenue florist
was delivered to the interesting occupant of a small, furnished
suite in an up-town apartment hotel. The regularity
of the “attention” quipped the management’s curiosity concerning
“Miss Trevor.” Usually such regardlessness was
followed by a gentleman in a hired car, wearing a fur-lined
overcoat and a manner at once suave and impatient. But no
gentleman had shown interest in this lady since the apartment
had been engaged and paid for by one whose coat was most
unpretentious and whose manner was neither suave nor
impatient&mdash;a pleasant-spoken, bald-pated, breezy type of a
man who somehow did not seem the sort to be telling it
daily “in flowers.”</p>

<p>Dolores herself had to guess from whom they came, just
as she assumed John Cabot’s wish that she let him fulfill
his promise to Jack “to look after her” until such time as
he thought wise to see her. Rufus Holt, who had found
and advised the new location, had made no explanation.
Even when he had closed her fingers around a roll of five
one-hundred-dollar bills, he had left her to assumption.</p>

<p>But Dolores <i>knew</i>. And, knowing, she was in a way content.
Alone except for the Airedale puppy, who had greeted
her more vociferously than the rest of her luggage, she
relaxed in her sense of an all-protective love and tried to
live on the significance of deep-hearted pansies, American
beauties and forget-me-nots.</p>

<p>At the end of the fourth week a receipt was tucked under
her living-room door for the second month’s rental in advance.
That it was not for three months&mdash;or six&mdash;gave her
a feeling of anticipation. A month at a time meant that a
change might be expected before the third payment became
due. With the expenditure of each dollar of her cash-in-hand
this feeling increased. Five hundred dollars was a
very great deal of money. But even five hundred would be
consumed in time by one healthy young woman and one
fast-growing dog. An all-protective love must realize that.
Perhaps by the time the five hundred was gone&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>She had to fight her first impulses of extravagance. Her
tendency was to tip unwisely and too well, to order a
superfluity of the disguising veils she had taken to wearing
on the long river-side tramps which were the anticipation of
the Airedale’s mornings and the reminiscences of his puppy
dreams at night; to let him grow too fat. Unable to decide
what name for the dog Jack’s old-young mind would have
hit upon, she continued to call him “puppy” or “pups,” as
certain unimaginative people she had known were satisfied
with “kittie” for their cat or “baby” for their child.</p>

<p>Conscientiously allowing herself only legitimate expenditures,
Dolores’ gladness increased, as her roll of bills thinned,
that it had not been a thousand, seven hundred, or even six.
It might so easily have been more. Toward the end of the
second month she felt hopeful&mdash;almost sure&mdash;that the worst
soon would be over. The very thought of it dizzied her with
happiness. To see him again, if only for a moment or
two&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>But she had to be satisfied with hearing his voice. Rung
suddenly from her sleep one night, she half believed his
telephone call a dream until the metallic sound of his up-hung
receiver told her that the opportunity was passed.
Until morning she lay awake, fondling, one by one, his carefully
covered sentences.</p>

<p>He had intended not to speak with her at present. But
the wish had conquered him to-night to hear her assurance
that she understood. He had been a criminal and must work
out his sentence. Under a sacred obligation to protect her,
he had injured her at each attempt, from the finale at the
lingerie shop to her present exile. She had shown pity for
his weakness before and perhaps could forgive him now. He
never could himself.</p>

<p>He had been overcome in the moment of his greatest
strength, when he had felt safe in his sorrow. Now, when
weakest, he dared not tempt himself. His only chance of
reinstating himself in his own opinion was to win the fight
he had undertaken. Their loyal acquaintance would explain.</p>

<p>Meantime was she well and would she try to be contented
until he could force a change? And would she believe?</p>

<p>That she did believe steadied Dolores through the discouragement
of another prepaid rent receipt. When the
“change” came, it was not of John’s enforcement. One
afternoon Rufus Holt called on her. He came in on the
breeze that wafted him through life. His smile was still
cheery, his manner even more courteous than usual. Yet he
was different. Considerately he attempted to “explain.”</p>

<p>The late chapters of that gilt-bound edition of womanhood,
Catherine Cabot, read like the cheapest of thrillers.
Soon after reëstablishing herself in her husband-less home,
she had sent for Dr. Shayle. What had passed between her
and the likable young man whom she had “made” in a week
was best judged by the fact that she un-made him in a day.
In notes, over the telephone and during such informal social
functions as she could make excuse to attend in her mourning,
she ruined him professionally. To his rich practice she
expressed her regrets that she no longer could sponsor him&mdash;that
his conduct with one who had brought disgrace to so
many had proved him an unfit person to have about the home
in his intimate capacity. All of which reminded Holt that
he had a letter for her.</p>

<p>The envelope which he tendered was addressed to and
had been opened by John Cabot. Above the heading of a
Chicago hotel was scrawled the osteopath’s name. Inside
was the request that Mr. Cabot forward to Miss Trent the
unsealed enclosure.</p>

<p>The note to Dolores read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dear You</i>:</p>

<p>My chief regret is having distressed you. Don’t be distressed
about me any more. Already my hurt is healing, salved by the
honor of having known you. I daren’t forget you, because remembering
you is the best thing in my life at the present
moment. Have refused the last bribe of her who made me
what I was&mdash;yesterday. Am on my way West where I can
start fair with doctor men who use their powers to help instead
of hinder. The ambition, I find, is not a gift&mdash;it’s inherited.
You great little chump, there is only one hope in my heart&mdash;may
you be happy.</p>

<p class="right smcap">
Dear Me.
</p>
</div>

<p>So then; to one, at least, she had not been a lasting grief!
Dolores felt very proud for herself and for Clarke Shayle.
She turned to her caller with the impulse to confide her good
news, but hesitated at the look of him. He had yielded to
the Airedale’s importunities and was scratching the stub ears.
The eyes of the dog were rolling from realized bliss. Those
of the implement of bliss were troubled. She could see that
attorney Holt was planning whatever he had come to say.</p>

<p>“Miss Trent,” he began on noting that he again had her
attention, “Mr. Cabot has been acting under my insistent
advice in not coming to see you. I know that he wishes to
come. My stand is based upon my high regard for him and,
may I add, for you? He intends to accomplish a divorce
from Mrs. Cabot as soon as possible, but on his own terms&mdash;terms
primarily calculated to repudiate the slurs cast upon
you. His ruling desire is to save your good name. I want
to see him carry out this idea. Miss Trent, do you?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, yes,” faltered the girl.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear you say that, because&mdash;Well, you and
he, lovely little lady, know better than I just why. His
position is at present extremely jeopardous. He is watched
night and day by detectives.”</p>

<p>“More detectives? But I thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I did, too. Mrs. Cabot, however, has not accepted Judge
Strang’s decision as final. She has postponed her trip abroad
and from Newport is directing an attack on his integrity
and mine. Through influence and the manipulations of a
brilliant shyster, she is trying to re-open the case in another
court. Meanwhile, she is acting on the theory expressed in
the old French proverb that ‘love and smoke are unable to
conceal themselves?’”</p>

<p>Evidently love, at least, was not. With his white, slim
hand Holt shielded his eyes from sight of her face and continued:</p>

<p>“More than before is the Cabot name threatened, your
good name and mine. Unless we are discreet she may have a
case which just might convince a judge less discerning than
my friend Roscoe Strang and let the Bar Association get its
claws into me. If your whereabouts should be chanced upon,
if the florist should be inspired to tell of the daily flowers
paid for by the lawyer who lost Mrs. Cabot’s first case,
even if friend pup here should yap his identity abroad&mdash;Do
you see, Miss Trent, why my advice has been insistent?”</p>

<p>After a keen glance at her he continued: “But I fear
that my advice is losing its punch. You see, I have an imagination.
I know John Cabot and I have seen you. Perhaps
I haven’t made clear the absolute faith I feel in both of you.
Wish I could put it beautifully with all the words and music.
But we men weren’t meant to be gods in strength, you know.
Why, even I have a secret vice!”</p>

<p>He smiled across at her youthfully; at her continued
silence, added:</p>

<p>“I wriggle my toes.”</p>

<p>But the girl did not smile back. She couldn’t</p>

<p>“What is it you wish me to do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I wish you to put yourself beyond reach. John’s weak
spot is you. He acknowledges it. He looks haggard and
acts worse&mdash;is beginning to fear that he can’t hold out.
And, of course, with that fear in his heart, he won’t. I
wish you to remove his temptation&mdash;until matters are adjusted,
not to let him know your whereabouts and under no
circumstances to write to him. Even his mail may be watched&mdash;there
can be traitors in any man’s office&mdash;and nothing is so
damning as written evidence.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Poor child.” Holt’s interruption expressed ever so much
of his pity. “Child first, then woman. You acknowledge
that I am right, don’t you? Then aren’t you willing to help
him? Only you can help him now. John is not a man to
talk, as you know, but he knows that I am his friend. ‘I
have just strength enough to stay away,’ he told me. ‘I’m
afraid that if I saw her, if she called me by so much as a
look&mdash;&mdash;’ You see, Miss Trent, the state to which the long
strain has reduced him? You want him to win his fight,
don’t you, for sake of his future and your own?”</p>

<p>“But you ask us to act like guilty persons,” she plead.
“Judge Strang said ‘not guilty.’ To me that means that
what&mdash;whatever we feel for each other is not guilt. If he is
not guilty, then neither am I. Why should I lower myself
to the standards of the world&mdash;why should I hide?”</p>

<p>“Because you are in the world and of it. I profess only
a man’s friendship for John Cabot. But to protect him I
played a rôle which is likely to ruin me professionally. He
relies on me at present to look after you. In the event of
his demanding to see you it would be better if even I did
not know your whereabouts. I’d advise that you go to the
shore somewhere. Let my secretary know when you decide
just where&mdash;you can reach him by telephone&mdash;and your
remittances will be sent regularly through him. Come,
lovely lady, what do you say? Is all John Cabot’s strength
to be discounted by his weakness for you?”</p>

<p>Dolores leaned over a bowl of purple pansies that kept
eyeing her from a nearby tabourette; gazed into their
ingenuous faces.</p>

<p>“But he wouldn’t leave me without a word, I know. What
would he think&mdash;how would he feel if I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Only in the event of his weakening need he know. Have
I impressed you with the fact that once he begins to see you,
he and I are done for? You are a woman of whom I would
have expected that self-sacrificing passion with which a man’s
friendship compares as a handshake to love’s first kiss. Are
you unwilling to seem to lose your case with him for a little
while?”</p>

<p>He arose, found his hat and stood for a moment looking
down at her. But she looked only into the pansies’ hearts.
A hopeful smile was on his face as he turned. He nodded
confidently at the Airedale, just before closing the door, very
quietly, after him.</p>

<p>The puppy, a man’s dog, sat sniffing and whining at the
sill for some time after his congenial acquaintance had gone.
But Dolores did not bewail the attorney’s exit. With a fury
strange to her, she resented his call, his gentleness and the
cruelty which it wrapped.</p>

<p>What manner of friendship was his, smilingly to urge the
torture of his friend in order to save himself? Where was
the worth of admiration that demanded of a peccable human
passion the blamelessness of one divine? The pansies knew
and she knew. But if John learned that she had hidden herself
away from him, how could he be expected to know?
Love was tender and easily hurt.</p>

<p>Rufus Holt admitted that he never had loved; that he had
only his imagination to depend upon. How dared he, then,
dictate to a woman whom he had acclaimed true as truth?</p>

<p>But that night a third voice entered the argument.</p>

<p>As Dolores lay abed, wooing in vain the healthful slumber
so seldom denied her, she came to wonder whether the
sensations which disturbed her were all mental. Could she
be physically ill?</p>

<p>As, hour on hour, the wonder and the strangeness of the
stirring within her grew, answer came in a wee, small voice&mdash;the
voice of fear&mdash;the voice of hope&mdash;perhaps, indeed, the
voice of that God said to speak through “the least of these.”
With none else to tell her, Dolores understood. And in the
darkness a great glory seemed to flood the room. Her heart,
which had slowed almost to stopping lest she miss the message,
near burst now with painful joy.</p>

<p>The voice, faint and from far away, had whispered unmistakably:</p>

<p>“<i>Woman, I am coming&mdash;thy fulfillment.</i>”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</h3>
</div>

<p>Dolores never sent her address to Rufus Holt’s secretary,
although she came in course of time to need the remittances
which were to be forwarded through him. She hated Holt
and loved John too much for that. Should that whisper in
the night be heard by the world, the fight of the strong would
indeed be lost to the weak. There was no choice. She must
hide herself that “little while,” guilty though she might appear.</p>

<p>She lived in various places. She found various employment.</p>

<p>There was the naturalized tailor who rented the basement
of the house where she had found a room and who seemed
to assume from “Mrs. Trevor’s” face that she could baste
“straight.” But she did not “naturalize,” either to the shop
or his idea of her, and he took to complaining of her work.
His subtlety was inadequate to cover his relief when she
transferred to a restaurant, one of the sort to which ladies
were “cordially” invited. But there came a day when this
proprietor, as well, begrudged the price of his mistake.</p>

<p>Even time and time’s tutelage did not take the strangeness
from the fact that no one wanted her about any more.</p>

<p>Weeks and months passed&mdash;Spring and Summer and another
Fall-time. She was forced to look at her funds, also
at the necessity to make them do. That grew to be her chief
concern&mdash;to make them do.</p>

<p>Moving her bags was expensive and thinning an Airedale
to the finest “point” of safety entailed anxiety. His canine
protests against the experiment were what first lifted her eyes
to a sign beside the door of a substantial house. A savoury
odor of beef stew wafted from the downstairs windows and
attracted the young dog so powerfully that, with ears laid
back and muscles straining against his leash, he pulled her
up the first two steps. What attracted the girl was the invitation
of brass letters laid upon an ebony board:</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Retreat for Wayward Girls</span><br />
</p>

<p>For more than two hours they had been walking slowly.
Each day now they walked more slowly. And the slower
they walked, the more urgent had grown their present landlady’s
“want” of their room. The window signs were scarce
in this cheap section of the city, said to be congested beyond
all record. And such “To Lets” as they had found were
said at the doors, after momentary inspection, to be already
“taken.”</p>

<p>So now, weariness and the odor of stew on the crisp
autumn air decided the dog. The cold sunlight falling upon
the topmost, polished word of the sign&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">RETREAT</span>&mdash;decided
the girl.</p>

<p>The matron proved to be a quite good imitation of a
mother. The girls under her charge were mostly repentant&mdash;some
she had graduated into good cheer. “Waywardness”
was an infliction to be frankly discussed; to be vied over,
sighed and cried over with consoling <i>camaraderie</i>. Even
the dog was pitied. Indeed, his demands for ready relief
were met far too generously for his gastronomic good.</p>

<p>Although the “new girl” did not explain about herself&mdash;there
was no need of that&mdash;she relaxed within the warming
atmosphere of the retreat and tried hard to please. Interestedly
she listened to tales of the benevolent gentleman
who directed the philanthropy. With so many examples of
waywardness about her, she came to take a less strained
view of her plight.</p>

<p>But the night and day stories poured into her ears&mdash;stories
of the undying devotion of the varied “friends” in the varied
inmates’ cases who, through varied circumstances, had been
separated from their hearts’ desires by cruel Fate&mdash;filled her
with a longing for John Cabot that increased with the approach
of her ordeal. Despite her unselfish resolves, she
wanted him to know. He must have been hurt if he knew
of her seeming desertion. Her past fear of the “risks,” as
italicized by Rufus Holt, was wiped off the slate of her mind.
The risk of death, which involved the greater risk of loss
of love, was writ instead&mdash;to stay.</p>

<p>She decided to disregard the lawyer’s caution to the extent
of a telephone call to John’s office. But he was not in
and she dared not leave name or number. To put anything
in writing was dangerous. Holt had warned her, yet a note
was the only recourse left&mdash;one brief, careful note. Stationery
and a pen she secured from the matron; forced herself
to write briefly and constrainedly; addressed it to Mr.
Cabot’s banking-house. Lest she permit apprehension to
change her mind, she placed her finished missive at once on
the table in the hall, where it would be given to the postman
on his next round.</p>

<p>She was returning to her room&mdash;very slowly now&mdash;when
the ensuing dialogue, first in a woman’s voice, then in a
man’s, came to her ears from behind a door marked “<span class="allsmcap">PRIVATE</span>”
that gave into the hall.</p>

<p>“With a sham like you, there’s nothing to life. Why
didn’t I see in time that my husband was the one who should
have lived&mdash;you the one to die?”</p>

<p>“How like a woman, to shift the blame! Wasn’t the
whole scheme your own&mdash;the cat-boat, the surprise attack,
that weird knowledge of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush, for Heaven’s sake!”</p>

<p>“See, you’re the guilty one. You tremble at the truth. I
never had heard of a death-spot in the human ear. I couldn’t
have struck true. And I couldn’t have play-acted your grief
over the accident. Certainly you ought to grant, Mary, that
I was all right then. Expected we’d be married like other
folks, once we’d got the business well started on the capital
from his life insurance. You say you have no respect for
me. Well, there’s more than one cause for a loss of respect.
What about mine for you? How can I know when some new
lover will tempt you to drive a nail through the lobe of
<i>my</i> ear&mdash;to throw <i>me</i> into a tide rip? It isn’t a man’s
nature, I tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t call yourself a man. You have cheated me unforgivably.
And yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘And yet.’ Thank God we’ve reached argument’s end
for to-day! We both know what we know and that I can
prove it. More than you hate me you fear me. Come, we
might as well be friends.”</p>

<p>“<i>Friends?</i> Remember that I can prove it, too, on you.”</p>

<p>“But you won’t, dear heart. Aren’t you tired yet of threatening
me? Eventually you’ll settle to living it out peaceably
on my terms. Why not now? Come. Be a sensible soul
and agree&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>One of the voices alone might have puzzled Dolores, but
together she had recognized both. They had struck her
like a blow. As if physically stunned, she had clung to the
balustrade for aid in undertaking the first few steps of the
stairway. By now, more strength came to her. Quietly and
rapidly as she could, she toiled beyond ear-shot up the
flight.</p>

<p>Out of breath she collapsed on her narrow iron bed; lay
realizing, not only the significance to herself of what she
had overheard, but its meaning to the two principals as
well.</p>

<p>So that was the hideous bond that tied them. That was
why each pretended an affection for, considered and, if
need be, defended the other. They had paid a human life
for love and found that crime brought only mutual contempt.</p>

<p>Through the realization of what enforced their hostile,
yet voluntary companionship came personal anxiety. Her
letter&mdash;what if he should notice and examine it? Why
hadn’t she taken it out and posted it herself?</p>

<p>But there was no time to be wasted over futile afterthoughts.
She could not chance his reading so much as
the address. She must recover her letter.</p>

<p>From the head of the stairs she could not see whether
or not it still lay on the table, which stood in the hall near
the street entrance. She could see, however, that the door
marked “<span class="allsmcap">PRIVATE</span>” was ajar. As no sound of voices came
to her, she concluded that the two in the hateful lockstep
must have gone. She counted possible costs, then again
descended the stairs.</p>

<p>They stood beside the table. Not until she saw their
faces would she believe the worst. Not only had he noticed
the address of the letter, but had opened and was reading it.</p>

<p>A smile was on his face&mdash;the æsthetic, pale-eyed, appealing
face of Vincent Seff. His agreeable laugh sounded as
he turned to Mrs. Hutton.</p>

<p>“Of all the chickens to come home to roost in the coop
of little Vin! You remember that pugilistic Puritan, John
Cabot? As addressed to him, Mary, what can these hieroglyphics
mean? Listen:</p>

<p>“‘Soon a rosebud will open its petals to the world. I
may not stay to care for it. I depend on you.’”</p>

<p>Impulse ruled Dolores. She crossed the hall; stretched
out her hand for the letter; faced them.</p>

<p>“It is mine. You have no right to read it.”</p>

<p>For a long moment Seff simply looked at her. Then he
took the lavender-bordered ’kerchief from his sleeve and
with it wiped his lips.</p>

<p>“Well met,” said he at last, “<i>Miss Nectarine</i>.”</p>

<p>“You have no right to open a sealed and stamped letter
intended for the mails,” Dolores insisted. “Will you give
it back to me or shall I appeal to the head of this institution?”</p>

<p>“Appeal. I am the head of the institution. I have a right
to do whatsoever I see fit within its hallowed walls.” The
satisfaction of his smile increased.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hutton, a shade grayer, calmer and handsomer, at
first had looked chiefly astonished. Now she intervened.</p>

<p>“Best give it back, Vin. Being what you are&mdash;or rather,
what you aren’t&mdash;you can have no interest in the affairs of
this girl, unless that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Unless that I do feel so obligated by my debts and her
I owe so much. But take your delicate little effusion. I
couldn’t possibly forget a word of it.”</p>

<p>Her letter in hand, Dolores turned and was about to undertake
the stairs again, when he stopped her.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, Miss Trent. How long will it take you
to retreat yourself out of here?”</p>

<p>“To retreat?” she asked. “But I thought the object of
this house&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Allow me to explain. The purpose of the institution is
to help girls who repent of their waywardness, not to encourage
hardened sinners. I have followed your career in the
newspapers. I consider it a privilege to have read your
latest attempt at extortion. Naturally I assume that, once
your present handicap is overcome, you’ll go on, like a
brook, purling round the hearts of men&mdash;on and on and on.
There are public reformatories for persons of your sort.
To realize our ideals, we must be somewhat particular
here.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hutton, as well as the girl, looked at him. Drawn
to the full of his dapper height, his face lit by artistic
appreciation of his own pose, his gesture delicately drawn,
he might have impressed a stranger as the benevolent of
the inmates’ praise.</p>

<p>But Mary Hutton was not a stranger. That equivocally
proud yet contemptuous smile was on her lips as she turned
to Dolores.</p>

<p>“You at least will have a child. I have nothing&mdash;nothing,”
she remarked. “Don’t be annoyed by a little thing like Vincent
Seff turned to philanthropy and good works.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ultimatum of the head of the Retreat increased
the urgency of Dolores’ letter. She posted it herself before
setting out to find a new place. She was fortunate, however.
Before night she had located a rooming-house “lady” sufficiently
in need, sufficiently pessimistic, sufficiently old and
shiftless and poor-spirited to waive references and accept
two weeks’ rental in advance. Here she laid in what she
still could pay for toward her needs; here lived along and
waited with hard-dying hope.</p>

<p>Since she had found the place so soon, she regretted the
hasty posting of her note. Rather than chance another of
those risks to John, of which the deposed shop-keeper’s suggestions
had increased her fear, she had given her new
address to that quite good imitation of a mother, the matron
of the Retreat, for the forwarding of mail or the convenience
of any friends who might telephone about her or call to
see her.</p>

<p>The incidents of her days became the variation from
morning confidence to evening despondency; of her nights,
the discarding, under crush of the blackness, of one after
another of her schemes for a second and more direct
message. And, whether in the daytime or at night, a bark
of the dog at an unaccustomed sound would rouse her to
radiance&mdash;to heart-hammering joy; or his growling return
to the tedium of his life would bring her back to heart-stilling
disappointment. Either John had made no response
to her appeal or the matron had failed to supply the address.</p>

<p>Heavier upon her pressed thoughts of the power of her
enemies. Where would her note lead Catherine Cabot if it
chanced into the hands of her hirelings? What might not
Seff reveal? How much might those omniscient detectives
learn from their watch of John?</p>

<p>So far Fate had conspired against her with a nice regard
for every detail. She became possessed by the pertinent
query: Why should <i>she</i> expect the mind of Fate to change?</p>

<p>Any question over the advisability of telephoning Rufus
Holt was answered by her inability to go out in search of
a booth. Just before one fevered dawn the idea of advertisement
came and crowded out the sickening controversy
over whether John or the matron was to blame. Why
hadn’t that occurred to her before? In a return of expectation,
she composed a “personal” that seemed to her adequately
“covered”&mdash;recognizable only to him addressed.
There was piquancy in the thought that the Press which had
been her enemy should now serve her as a friend. Fortunate
that she knew which of the morning papers he was accustomed
to read with care&mdash;doubly fortunate that there still
was enough left of her hoard to pay for a single notice.</p>

<p>The poor-spirited landlady looked especially pessimistic
over the errand on which she was asked to go, any chance
of a reward depending upon its success. Her new tenant
was likely to be a great deal of trouble, she anticipated aloud,
and she never before had been reduced to taking dogs. Had
not the room been so long vacant, she would not have considered
the pair of them. She suspected, moreover, from
the things they were doing without, that they had about
reached the limit of their wherewithal. However, none could
say but what she always looked on the bright side of
things and she’d do her best about getting all the display
the money would buy for the personal.</p>

<p>Dolores’ confidence increased after the old woman had
gone. Such doubts as crowded in, she exorcised with the
reminder that her advertisement would have succeeded or
failed in one day’s time. Often in the past she had deplored
the fact that the marvelous output of the press should die
in a day; now she rejoiced in the fact. By to-morrow he
would have come or&mdash;But she would not&mdash;dared not face
the alternative.</p>

<p>That night her baby was born.</p>

<p>The old woman did what she had time for and the charity
doctor stayed a while. Afterward, Dolores must have sunk
into a state of semi-consciousness&mdash;must have slept or dozed
away the time, for she roused to incredulity on being told that
it was noon of the next day.</p>

<p>Two other facts penetrated her listlessness. The life of
that day’s <i>Times</i> must soon be spent and her child was a
girl.</p>

<p>Suppose he did not come. That meant that another girl-child
was fatherless. Already, in the world’s opinion, she
would be accounted worse than motherless.</p>

<p>As before, time became merely a variation of hope and
despondency.... What was that? Surely, an Airedale
bred to watchfulness would not grow so excited had he not
recognized a step or voice!... But no, he was a silly
dog, silly and extremely bored. He and she, too, must have
imagined the step and the voice.</p>

<p>A girl, their babe&mdash;a hapless, little human, who was not
to inherit even such paternal affection and care as could be
spared from poppy paste. Another girl she had brought into
a world which had no justice for unprotected girls....
Perhaps, if he did not come, it would be best that their baby
be spared the learning of life&mdash;the humiliations, the disillusionments,
the death-stab of love that lied.... Since he
had not come, love <i>must</i> have lied. Both her messages would
not have gone astray. There was significance in this second
failure. Too late to protect her from his weakness had
come his strength. If he did not, <i>would</i> not come&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She must be very ill; must have dozed off a while&mdash;that is,
if the old woman told the truth about night having come
again.... Likely she <i>had</i> told the truth, for the room
was quite dark, except for the one dim gas-jet lit in the old-fashioned
chandelier.</p>

<p>The landlady had come in to say that she wanted the room
as soon as Dolores was able to get about. A refined adult&mdash;a
single gentleman&mdash;had enquired about it that day. Mrs.
Trevor should remember her saying from the first that she
never took in dogs or babies. She knew what babies were&mdash;just
one sick spell after another. And she had no space in
the back-yard for regular laundry. She was a kind-hearted
woman and honest about her bargains, the Lord knew. But
she had herself to think of and the other folks in the house.
She wasn’t one to worry a fellow woman sick-a-bed, but the
gent had said he would stop in the morning for his answer.
Naturally, she would need to name the exact day he could
come. Her soft heart always had been her worst enemy,
but business was business.</p>

<p>After the old woman had dismalled herself out, Dolores’
gaze again strayed to the gas-jet. The turned-down flame
fascinated her and seemed to make a light in her mind. It
flickered an answer to the embarrassing question of when
she could give over the room.... What time was it now?...
Nine o’clock.... The day that was the life of
a news sheet was long since done....</p>

<p>There were three jets to the chandelier. It wasn’t going to
take long. Already she was affected by the fumes. The dog
was sniffing suspiciously, whining protest....</p>

<p>“A life for a life,” she told him unfeelingly, thinking of
Jack, the only one who ever had loved without harming
her. But then&mdash;the Airedale, after all, had not asked Jack’s
life any more than she had asked her mother’s.... She
arose, tottered to the door, took him by the nape of the neck
and thrust him into the pure air of the hall.</p>

<p>Fortunately the babe was too young to realize or complain;
would never know about life&mdash;never know. Dolores
held the small form to her heart and shuddered anew over
what life might have meted out to so tiny and helpless a
creature.</p>

<p>“There is the mark of the seal they call the signet of
Solomon,” she mumbled through the dark to the chandelier.
“There are to will and to have your will. There are your
social ideas, your excesses, your pleasures that end in
death&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Who was it had reminded her of Maupassant not so very
long ago? Oh, yes.... That night.... What,
indeed, was folly but “a riotous expenditure of will”?...
He had not seemed a man to shirk the obligations
of his folly&mdash;John Cabot&mdash;that night. Yet he had not come....
So tender he had seemed in his madness for her;
so willing to deny himself; so determined to consider her.
He had made her realize the happiness which she and Jack
had tried to learn from a bird.... Still, where now&mdash;happiness?...
And God&mdash;where was God?</p>

<p>Who was bending over her?... Amor&mdash;could that
be the gallant love-lad, so broken and so gaunt? Had he
come to mock her?... And was it Innocentia clinging,
peaked and weeping, to his hand?</p>

<p>Sorry comforters, the two. Their visit distressed her
more than the nauseous fumes from the jets.</p>

<p>There were Vincent Seff and Mary Hutton, now. Why
were they still together?... Strange that whichever
died first, the other would be there, attentive to the end
lest the fear of God overcome the fear of man in a death-bed
repentance.... They could be sure of each other’s
company to the end.... Hate, then, bound people
closer than love.... Love? How lonely was love!</p>

<p>“I never&mdash;knew God, but I knew&mdash;you. Why&mdash;<i>why</i> hast
thou&mdash;forsaken&mdash;me?”</p>

<p>The gasp was wrung from her stress of body and soul. In
the darkness and the aloneness it quavered heartbrokenly
upward with her thought of John Cabot.</p>

<p>Then she remembered the lady she had admired in the
railway station, long, long ago&mdash;the lady who had sneezed.
She hadn’t made the usual fuss about it; had just leaned
out and done it, neatly and composedly.... What was
human life but a sneeze? Birth was the warning; youth the
preparation; life the sniffing and death the wiping of eyes.
After death perhaps one settled back into composure....
The lady had proved a good example in so many crises of her
life. It was well to have remembered her in death....
She must make no fuss; must do it neatly and composedly.</p>

<p>She threw back her head; set her lips hard; breathed deep
and long ... deep and long ... deep and
long....</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</h3>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon
under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve
stars. And she, being with child, cried, travailing
in birth and pained to be delivered.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>The girl-shade heard the words intoned in <i>mezzo voce</i>. At
the door of the throne-room she paused, loath to enter the
next scene of the co-star piece. All the day following the
completion of her story of earth she had lain within her
chamber, in a state of narcosis, varied only by the dull
ache of dread. All day she had expected the summons which
now had come, that she appear before the King. Through
the séances she had done her best; had whipped her spirit
as a slave-seller might have lashed some modest, naked body
on the block. She had come for the reckoning. If so be it
she had met the royal expectations, her reward would be
that lowest high office yet assigned in Greater Gehenna&mdash;She-Destroyer
of Womankind. If she had failed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>And the dragon stood before the woman which
was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as
soon as it was born.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Again the deep intonations. Glancing into the blaze of
light which had confused her eyes after her approach
through the dim, winding corridors, Dolores saw a tall figure
in the full effect of male evening attire on earth, with
back toward her and gestures directed into one of the mercurized
walls.</p>

<p>Her hesitation was mastered by surprise. Even on closer
view, she scarcely could believe that this superb copy of the
men of Earth indeed was His Satanic Majesty. His hair,
formerly pompadoured to conceal his horns, was clipped,
parted on one side and slicked back, the indices of power
evidently razored close. The auburn Vandyke which had
been inseparable from her concept of him was the more
noticeable now for its absence. In its place, a smile whose
charm would have been hard to describe clothed the well-sculped
lips.</p>

<p>The lines and color of His Highness’ costume adhered to
what she knew was “latest” form&mdash;all except his tie. That
was of a red which vividly reminded her of that Justice
Roscoe Strang, whose independence of judicial precedent
had been suggested by a like daring note in otherwise sombre
dress.</p>

<p>“Ah, sweet Grief,” he saluted her. “I feel indebted to you
for the basic idea of my sermon on ‘The Service of Suicide.’
You’ve caught me at a rehearsal. I was just reading my text,
‘To Hell with the Ill-Begot.’ We mustn’t overlook the
propaganda out of the mouths of babes and sucklings in
our new Drive of Destruction, eh?”</p>

<p>“Mustn’t we?” she evaded wretchedly.</p>

<p>“Come, cheer down! Did my mere mention of a sermon
make you pull the doleful face of the average religionist
in church? You haven’t said how you like my style to-night.
Am I not beautiful and <i>à la mode</i>?”</p>

<p>He appeared to be in an unusually amiable mood. A turn
or two he took around her, evidently to note the reflection
on her face as well as in the mirror.</p>

<p>“Is it possible&mdash;&mdash;” in sudden suspicion he peered at her&mdash;“that
you don’t like me razored?”</p>

<p>“You look&mdash;very well.”</p>

<p>“I look&mdash;‘very well.’” He aped her effortful tone. “Didst
note her burst of enthusiasm? In gratitude, she’s not so different
from the rest of womankind. What one of them
ever realized that a man would rather remove a mountain
from the physiognomy of the earth than the beard from his
face? As for the horns from his head!”</p>

<p>“But really, I do like it&mdash;very well indeed!”</p>

<p>“‘Very well indeed’!” Satan threw out his hands in a
farcical gesture of despair. “What man who shaves his
beard to please a woman ever really pleases her?”</p>

<p>“To please me, Your Lowness?”</p>

<p>“Sin’s idea. That silhouette you drew of your pet philanthropist
shows you to have preconceived ideas of the looks
of latter-day devils. I haven’t spent centuries catering to
human preconceptions for nothing. Presto, even John
Cabot’s crime toward you is no blacker than my cut-faced
clothes! My tie is a bit off&mdash;that is <i>on</i>&mdash;color, as it were.
But I notice that no man is held accountable for his taste
in cravats. Maybe I <i>was</i> dressed like a character part.”</p>

<p>With the frank self-appreciation of a husband who has just
been hectored into an evening suit by his wife, he turned
for a critical survey of her appearance.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you looking fit to go out with me,” he
approved. “I have planned to take you to a show.”</p>

<p>“To hear you preach?” She put the assumption rather
eagerly. “I am so glad. I have hoped each night you
would take me. Frequently when hearing you talk, I have
wondered whether you would&mdash;whether you wouldn’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She faltered at his look of amazement.</p>

<p>“If I wouldn’t just what, child?” he encouraged with all
the unctuous kindliness of the Rev. Dr. Alexander Willard.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t teach me the Scriptures. You seem to know
them by heart.”</p>

<p>“By head, not by heart. There’s a difference, you know.
Ingersoll knew them by head.” Satan’s chuckles began with
contemplation of her idea. “Really, you are either the most
naïve or the most intriguing of lost souls.”</p>

<p>“But seriously,” she insisted.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>seriously</i>!” He laughed the more. “Well, seriously,
my poor child, I’d advise you to remember the clay feet of
the ‘Sporting Parson.’ Far be it from me to try to improve
a perfectly bad mind. ‘The Little Book shall be in thy
mouth sweet as honey, but shall make thy belly bitter.’ That’s
one of my own handy, illiterate translations. M’lady, the
carriage awaits. Time we were on our way.”</p>

<p>He was pleased to drive her to the promised entertainment
in his favorite Hawk. While drifting through the
drab air of night in Gehenna, lit only by that “pale, abiding
light” whose dynamo was beyond control of his electricians,
he explained the kind of “show” to which he was escorting
her. In it he was not to star, no. It was only a motion
picture, but one in which he felt that she, as well as he,
would take interest.</p>

<p>They were to see, in fact, a picturization of certain unfinished
details connected with her own career on earth, over
which he, for one, felt curiosity. He had ordered the life-films
to date of John Cabot brought from the supply house
and cut to give a comprehensive exposé of a character that
would refuse to heed the death cries of a girl whom, by the
honor code of Earth, he was bound to protect. Satan himself
had hit on an apt title, but had not previewed the picture
and had left the sub-titling to his first fiend-scenarist. He
hoped for an entertaining and regardless presentation.</p>

<p>At the Devil’s Own Playhouse it was evident that the
feature had been extensively billed. The capacity of the
theater was taxed to standing-room when the King led his
interesting guest into the royal box. Down over the billows
of faces that waved back at their entrance, Dolores looked
with pitying eyes. On a few was apathy; on more, fevered
eagerness; on most, apprehension. The Sea of the Fear of
Despair they were&mdash;a Dead Sea, indeed. She, too, soon was
carried out toward its white-caps of hoping thoughts, caught
in its undertow. This she realized from the emotion
within herself which began with the curtain’s rise&mdash;the deeps
of heartbreak disturbed by the high-winds of hope.</p>

<p>The camera was said not to lie. If His Highness’ boasted
topical review was bona-fide, some excuse might evolve for
him who had refused to heed her call.</p>

<p>The series of incidents unfolded upon the super-quick
silver screen may most readily be grasped, perhaps, by a
perusal of the working synopsis to which the master-director
of Hell Films cut the production.</p>

<p>(<i>On Screen</i>)</p>

<p class="smcap">The turn turtle is an insignificant reptile, great
only in its cowardice. It never looks danger in the
face, but at first alarm pulls in its head and scuddles
away. Watch this one.</p>

<p>Turtle enters slowly. Protrudes head. Looks around.
Face changes to that of John Cabot. A pair of hands&mdash;recognizably
Dolores Trent’s&mdash;appear. Stretch toward turtle.
Face shows fright. Head withdraws into shell. Turtle
crawls off.</p>

<p>(<i>On Screen</i>)</p>

<h5>THE FIRST TURN</h5>

<p>John Cabot enters his Broad Street office. Seats himself
at desk. Goes through pile of letters in weary manner. Stops
to study one.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Show, in Dolores’ Handwriting&mdash;Envelope of Dolores’ note,
with “Personal” underscored and the return address of
Retreat for Wayward Girls in corner.</i>)</p>

<p>John interrupted by arrival of Rufus Holt who looks
worried, but tries to cheer up when John asks about Dolores.
Attorney assures John:</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>Miss Trent is comfortably settled at a shore
resort, as well and happy as can be expected until matters
are settled.</i>”</p>

<p>With a gesture John asks Holt to wait until he has
finished his mail. Again takes up Dolores’ letter. Is unfolding
enclosure when Catherine, in street costume, enters. She
shows amused surprise at Holt’s presence, but insists that
he remain when he attempts to leave.</p>

<p>She takes chair which John places for her. From her
purse produces a ticket which she offers for his inspection.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Show&mdash;Transportation on Trans-Atlantic Blimp.</i>)</p>

<p>At John’s surprise, Catherine offers plaintive explanation:</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>In two weeks I am going abroad as a sort of
memorial to Jackie&mdash;to help mother the war orphans
over there.</i>”</p>

<p>John studies her coldly, taps forefinger on desk as replies:</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>Another of your trick trips! Well, Europe is
not far these days. A radiogram, a quick flight home
and better luck with your suit-for-absolute next time&mdash;perhaps.</i>”</p>

<p>Catherine affects sadness at his suspicion. Droops toward
him over desk with reproachful, luring smile. Seems about
to weep. Feels for ’kerchief. Drops eyelids. Is able to
read Dolores’ envelope. Picks it up. Studies it. Sneers:</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>What a heart you have for wayward girls! Is
this a love letter or a dun?</i>”</p>

<p>Ends interview with steady stare of suspicion at Holt,
who stands nervously beside a window.</p>

<p>When Catherine has gone, John settles his own wonder
on subject.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Show in Dolores’ handwriting&mdash;“Soon a rosebud will open
its petals to the world. I may not stay to care for it. I
depend on you.</i>”)</p>

<p>John turns upon Holt. Without explaining, accuses him
of perfidy. Holt departs, depressed by their danger of
exposure.</p>

<p>John calls a taxi. Drives at once to the Retreat. Is
putting his query to the matron when Vincent Seff emerges
from room marked “Private.” Mutual recognitions instant.
Seff does the lofty philanthropic. In answer to John’s demands
claims to know nothing of Miss Trent except that
duty forced him to eject her from Home the previous day.</p>

<p>Matron tries to proffer her information, but is cut short
by Seff, who assures her aside:</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>It is for the girl’s best good that we throw this
blood-hound off the scent. Trust my judgment.</i>”</p>

<p>Matron retires from scene without giving address. Seff,
with exaggerated courtesy draped over his triumph and
sneers, shows John the door.</p>

<p>John drives at once to a detective agency. There, with
hard-suppressed impatience, he retains them to find the girl
he had not known was lost. Suggests:</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>Comb all the taxi and express stands in the
vicinity, grill the matron of the Retreat and shadow
Seff.</i>”</p>

<p>Scene shifts to hallway outside Dolores’ room. Aged
landlady emerges. Puts on spectacles. Reads advertisement
entrusted to her.</p>

<p>(<i>On Screen in Dolores’ Handwriting</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wasted</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Unless you come to me at once.</i><br />
<i>979 East 17th Street.</i>
</p>

<p>Counts money given for its insertion. Departs kitchen-ward.
Mutters:</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>Money’s a sure thing. This ad. ain’t. I owe
something to myself and sure, so does she.</i>”</p>

<p>As days pass John is tortured by alternate hope and disappointment.
Detectives make reports, but nothing comes
of their search. He grows haggard and desperate.</p>

<p>Catherine comes again to office with an appeal to his
patriotism. Expresses herself as shocked by change in him.
Gets generous check for her proposed philanthropy abroad.
Suggests sarcastically:</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>Better join me in this sail overseas. With your
money and your sympathy for waywardness, you’d find
a lot to do in demoralized Europe.</i>”</p>

<p>John scorns even to refuse. Once outside office, Catherine
seeks a telephone booth. Gets her own detective agency.
Orders extra close watch on husband’s movements.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen</i>)</p>

<h5>THE SECOND TURN</h5>

<p>At his club John finds himself distracted. Cannot listen
to conversation of friends. Seeks office. Over telephone
gets the usual assurance from his detective that “something”
is about to happen. Decides to wait at office. Looks at
desk calendar.</p>

<p class="hanging2">
(<i>Show&mdash;October 31, date of Dolores’ death.</i>)</p>

<p>John paces floor through terrible night. Imagines forms
of Amor and Innocentia pleading with him. Sees reproachful
face of Jack peering at him from the shadows. Curses
past weakness and present impotency.</p>

<p>The while, in bedroom at Cabot town-house, Catherine
sleeps. Smiles like innocent child in her guilty dreams.</p>

<p>Dolores’ landlady arises from sound slumber. Goes about
her sordid tasks. Smells gas. Traces it. Airedale is on
guard outside tenant’s door. Landlady entices him away
with bit of meat from kitchen below. Breaks into room.
Makes startling discovery. Mother and babe dead upon the
bed. Her first thought after turning off gas is for meter.
Reads it. Gets greatly excited.</p>

<p>In kitchen landlady retrieves Dolores’ advertisement and
money for payment. On consideration, decides that best
chance of getting bill paid by a dead tenant lies in possible
live answer to the ad. Goes to <i>Times</i> office on belated
errand. Proffers “personal.”</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen</i>)</p>

<p class="smcap">In this wise&mdash;and only one day late&mdash;the “Personal”
of Dolores Trent appears.</p>

<p>In office of afternoon newspaper veiled ad. catches eye
of sub-editor.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen in Print</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wasted</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Unless you come to me at once.</i><br />
<i>979 East 17th Street.</i>
</p>

<p>Editor calls reporter, who goes to East Side address.</p>

<p>John emerges from club with copy of <i>Times</i> under arm.
At curb buys copies of two other newspapers. As gets into
limousine, lets one&mdash;the <i>Times</i>&mdash;fall into mud.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen</i>)</p>

<p class="smcap"> As usually happens, the “Personal” is not read by
the person for whom intended.</p>

<p>John glances at fallen paper regretfully. As cab starts,
turns to financial pages of other paper.</p>

<p>Up street wind drives copy of <i>Times</i>. Blows it open.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen in Print</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wasted</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Unless you come to me at once.</i><br />
<i>979 East 17th Street.</i>
</p>

<p>Hoof of dray horse stamps out legibility of printed words.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen</i>)</p>

<p class="smcap">Well it is for the solving of mysteries that the
public need not depend upon the mysterious ways
of detective agencies.</p>

<p>Reporter finds East Seventeenth Street address. Frightens
landlady with questions about ad. Persuades her to let
him into Dolores’ room. Recognizes face of notorious girl.
Emerges under thrill of a “beat.”</p>

<p>Rewrite man in evening newspaper office takes discovery
over telephone. Rattles sensational story through typewriter
and composing room into print.</p>

<p>In another office an un-wise old “owl” of John’s detective
agency gets start from headlines of latest edition.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen in Print</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dolores Trent a Suicide<br />
Goes to End by Gas<br />
Takes Birthling for Company.</i>
</p>

<p>Agency chief shows himself capable of real speed after
things have been detected for him. Makes for John’s office.
Must prepare employer for shock, he declares. They have
found the girl, although dead. The address is John’s only
demand. It is supplied without reference to newspaper. He
hastens there.</p>

<p>Pessimistic landlady will let none except authorities into
bedroom until bills are paid.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>It uses up a sight of gas to kill a woman grown
and a healthy baby.</i>”</p>

<p>John crushes green-backs into her hand and strides into
room.</p>

<p>Upon bed lies dead girl.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen</i>)</p>

<p  class="smcap">With backthrown silken hair her mourning
veil, all smileless in death as she had been
through life, she clasps to her breast the clay of
his child and hers, of whose existence a detective
had told him. “Grief to Men” at last teaches one
man the acme of grief.</p>

<p>John bends over her. His lips move.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>I have murdered what I love. Can you forgive?</i>”</p>

<p>Sinks to knees beside bed. Lays face in her hair. Shudders
in agony of regret.</p>

<h5>THE THIRD TURN</h5>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen</i>)</p>

<p class="smcap">The digit of death points back to the divorce case
of Cabot vs. Cabot.</p>

<p>In imposing room of Bar Association, Rufus Holt stands
trial for his professional life. Is charged with having thrown
the first divorce case he ever lost. Faces of jury of
brother lawyers grow contemptuous when prosecutor sums
up evidence against him&mdash;his visit to Judge Strang’s apartment
with Cabot co-respondent, as reported by elevator man,
later protectorate of girl and payment of her bills, as proved
by florist and manager of up-town hotel, and continued
friendship with John Cabot. Now suicide of girl and death
of infant conceived during period of sojourn in philanthropist’s
home clinches case.</p>

<p>Holt to be formally disbarred. Is broken by disgrace and
denied friendship of man for whom he took risk. Leaves
trial room.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen</i>)</p>

<p class="smcap">
Mrs. Cabot finds a new use for “blimps.”</p>

<p>In her quarters at Cabot town-house, Catherine and maid
are engaged in packing trunks. Two society friends announced.
Shown into disordered suite. Ask questions. Is
it true, as papers say, that Mrs. Cabot is going to make trans-Atlantic
flight? Catherine gives laughing assurance:</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>I’ve always enjoyed being first, my dears. I guess
I am first to fly from unpleasant notoriety. It will be
a joy-ride, as my new lawyer is sure of winning my
reopened suit.</i>”</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen</i>)</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">
DUST TO DUST<br />
</p>

<p>Beside grave of Trevor Trent, jovial digger finishes double
task. Enters auto hearse, followed by single limousine. John
steps from car as coffin is lowered. Carries arm-load of
roses. Holds face emotionless. Tears off handful of rose
petals. Scatters them into grave. Lips move.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>God teach me that nothing is wasted. God grant
that nothing is wasted.</i>”</p>

<p>As he turns away, with last offices performed, is halted
and questioned by reporter who first published news of
Dolores’ death. John at first refuses to answer. Shows
deep thought, then inspiration.</p>

<p class="hanging2">
(<i>Insert</i>) “<i>You may say that I am sailing for Europe in
the trans-Atlantic blimp. Yes, with Mrs. Cabot.</i>”</p>

<p>Reporter stands astonished. Stares.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>On Screen</i>)</p>

<p class="smcap">That John Cabot deserves his reputation for shrewdness
is the news-hound’s thought. So that is his
latest scheme for protecting the name of the Trent
girl&mdash;to stop the possible reopening of his wife’s suit
by flying abroad with her, Whether she wants him
or not!</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>Cut Back</i>) Turtle appears. Protrudes head. Sees appealing
hands. Withdraws head. Turns. Scuddles away.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</h3>
</div>

<p>For minutes after the lights had flashed over The Devil’s
Own, the two in the royal box sat gazing at the flat silver
surface so recently deep with the shadows and high-lights
of life as lived on Earth. Neither noticed that the dead
sea of faces below was enlivened by recognition of the King’s
favorite before it ebbed away beneath the balcony. Neither
heard the swish of whispers that passed from wave to wave&mdash;gossip
retailed from court, vilified innuendo, speculation
over the Belialic intent in entertaining the lately arrived star
of the piece with her death’s aftermath.</p>

<p>In truth, both host and guest were self-absorbed in emotion
roused by the play, but emotion quite antipodal. His shaved
face showed plainly his astonishment; worked with his darkling
rage. Hers lifted roofward a glory that so outshone
the super-lighted dome as to suggest the far-distant source
of that radiance which no Avernian device might dim.</p>

<p>“It was not what I expected&mdash;the picture,” Satan remarked,
with ominous restraint. “The titling was good, but
the plot didn’t fit. The damned turn-turtle didn’t turn!”</p>

<p>Dolores was too charged with an inspired decision to
realize his displeasure. She turned to him; stretched out her
hand; touched his arm.</p>

<p>“You said you could put me in spiritual connection with
the women of Earth,” she reminded him. “Could you also
with men&mdash;with John?”</p>

<p>“And why, pray, with John?”</p>

<p>The cruelty of the smile which had been so charming
awhile back should have warned her, but she must have
been blinded by that light from within.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see how he suffered from self-reproach?
Don’t you realize that he still is suffering?” She sighed in
her voice of sad winds. “Surely you gathered from the picture
that all those age-long minutes of the time I died from
doubt, he still loved me&mdash;that he loves me now? I want
to implore his forgiveness.”</p>

<p>Her smile, timid from its rarity, strained to disappear,
although she tried to hold it.</p>

<p>“I’ve done my best to please you,” she wheedled nervously.
“Won’t you do this for me&mdash;just free my spirit for one
short hour by the time of Earth?”</p>

<p>“So! You’d rather go back to that puny mortal than on
and on&mdash;with me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’ll come back, and go on and on so cheerfully!
I give you my word,” she assured him. “I’ll do everything
I can for you. Just grant me the hour. It’s not the fraction
of a second to you. You say that you never have cared
for anyone. Yet you boast of your imagination. Can’t you
imagine what it is really to care? Won’t you even try?”</p>

<p>“I might do that.” He eyed her. “I might try.”</p>

<p>All the drive home his manner was detached. He did not
repulse her gratitude for his grudging consideration of her
request. Neither did he explain that he was trying to
imagine what “caring” would be like&mdash;but trying through
jealousy, its crudest mood.</p>

<p>“I will tell you&mdash;well, afterward,” he said, on bidding her
“sleep light” within Apollyon Palace.</p>

<p>“After what?”&mdash;she.</p>

<p>“That I don’t know myself as yet,” he snapped.</p>

<p>Afterward&mdash;if only we could know the afterward before!</p>

<p>She slept light. And through the next day her regret
increased that she had not dared his wrath and demanded
a definite period to her suspense. Feelings unwontedly rebellious
filled her that she must wait to know&mdash;rather, that
John must wait.</p>

<p>Over the babe&mdash;their babe&mdash;she crooned her hope. To
Adeline she whispered her apprehension. Something in the
hard, planning look of the unfair fiend, in his superiority to
any attempt at cleverness, in his abstraction even while listening
to compliments over his driving&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>When</i> was afterward?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Satan, too, asked himself questions through that day.</p>

<p>A far busier leader than any king or president of Earth,
since he had the evil of all nations to direct, he yet found
time from his activities to remember the boomerang blow to
himself of last night’s “show.”</p>

<p>His chamber of state glowed as with St. Elmo’s fire, while
he lightning-flashed his orders through infinity, defying the
“static” of Earth and Heaven and the void between. Piteously
he drove his Minions of Malice toward the consummation
of crimes unique or foul enough to merit his supervision.
No measurement exists to compute the watts of
energy required to transmit the royal will in this orgy of
action. But what did he care that the Gehennan sun was
dimmed by the draught until it looked a mere balloon?</p>

<p>As the artificial daylight went into eclipse, greener grew
the color of the Satanic mood&mdash;a hard green, mixed from
the yellow of chagrin and the blue-black of rage. He felt
as mean as a son-in-law. It did not help in the slightest to
have Old Original commiserate him on the projection of a
picture which had shown his rival running true; no more did
that unworthy’s impious request that he be appointed royal
previewer of all future films. Even the minister’s report
on the entire success of a particularly contemptible political
coup which he had devised for the postponement of that
good will toward men threatened in the “Little Book” did
not long divert him.</p>

<p>At length, consigning the rest of the day’s deviltry to
various fiend aides, the Author of Evil forced his mind to
concentrate on the vital question evolved from last night.
How best might mortal pusillanimity be revealed to the
rose-goggled eyes of true love?</p>

<p>Through the mood which he had been suffering since the
fiasco of his “evening out,” he recognized violent tendencies
within himself which made him feel, more than ever before,
his power to devise and inflict suffering. In this case, however,
violence would not do; would destroy what he wished
to create. With meticulous delicacy he must handle this
mind feminine if he hoped to pluck therefrom its dearest
idealization.</p>

<p>What can the heart of woman not forgive? He asked
himself and considered, one by one, many answers.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> never could forgive infidelity!”</p>

<p>At that loudest and oftenest cry of the wives of the world
the malignant lips curled. “<i>Never?</i>” Yet most did forgive
who found it advisable so to do.</p>

<p>“Liquor? I <i>couldn’t</i> endure that kind of a beast.”</p>

<p>But which martyr-wife exchanged her drunken lord except
for a better fate?</p>

<p>“Dishonesty? I <i>wouldn’t</i> live with a man I didn’t respect.”</p>

<p>Wouldn’t she? Then why were the jail-gates draped with
weeping faces and stretching arms&mdash;why the late-life efforts
to “live it down” of the work-wasted woman and the husband
who had served out his time?</p>

<p>Never? Couldn’t? Wouldn’t? What the heart of woman
cannot forgive is what she has not been called upon to forgive.
The libertine’s lady might just as well have learned
to endure shame through ebriety, the drunkard’s dupe
through lechery.</p>

<p>What type of man, then, does the mind of woman most
despise? A villain? Scarcely, when the worst are loved
the best. A traitor, a weakling, a failure? For the lowest
of these, pardons are plead. Upon them, regenerating love
is poured. What&mdash;<i>what</i> to her is the sin unpardonable?</p>

<p>With eyes closed against possible distractions, Satan rough-shadowed
the suspects of his thoughts. And just when
his mind seemed emptied of ideas, he had it.</p>

<p>Of course. <i>Of course.</i> A caught coward was what she
could not forgive, woman. He would star one earthling for
benefit of his spirit-mate in a play of cowardice. “Afterward”?
After he was through, she scarcely would press her
request.</p>

<p>From their Limbian “Information” he inquired the name
of the personal devil of John Cabot. Upon learning that an
imp named Okeh attended the banker, he demanded instant
connection by wireless telephone. This he got with a promptness
that might be commended to the attention of mortal
systematizers.</p>

<p>“That you, Okeh?” he asked. “I hear that you’re responsible
for the evil impulses of a Mr. John Calvin Cabot....
You speak as if you were proud of the fact. You needn’t
be.... What say?... But I have a perfectly bad
right to insult you.... A chance at me is just what
I’m going to give you&mdash;a chance to prove your efficiency. I
want the Cabot program for the immediate future. Quick,
now. I am not used to waiting.”</p>

<p>Amid sulphuric anathemas at his informant, Satan noted
the report. Sailing for Europe in half an hour on a trans-Atlantic
air-liner, was he? And enemy wife, all unknowing
as yet, was blimping it along? In the old nick of time, as
usual, was he to wish the undevoted couple <i>mal voyage</i>.
So the Marquis d’Elie, too, was to be on board? After
all, the “Turn Turtle” must think more of the Trent girl’s
battered reputation than of his own pleasure.</p>

<p>If the big blimp was to sail in a few minutes, what was
Mr. Cabot doing in the morasses of Brooklyn, only half way
to the flying field? The agate-eyed personal devil was ready
with explanations. The gentleman’s wife was reopening a
suit for divorce on the strength of an illegitimate child whom
circumstantial evidence proved to be his. The air trip was
to celebrate all but the actual verdict in her favor. Cabot had
started late that he might board at the last moment, thereby
giving her an unhappy surprise. His car unfortunately had
run into a jam around an open-air evangelist&mdash;a sensational
religionist who was enthralling crowds everywhere, the Rev.
Dr. Alexander Willard by name.</p>

<p>Scarcely could Satan restrain his risibilities. What a
contretemps! Here was the deposed divine, forced to the
Free Church of Outdoors by the siren Grief, with his eloquence
delaying her last victim’s flight from the scandal she
had brought upon him. How delightfully diabolic!</p>

<p>For sake of his own recent experiment at popularizing the
once tedious sermon, His Augustness had Okeh short-mouth
for him certain of “Nimrod’s” shots.</p>

<p>“I used to hunt birds and beasts. Now I hunt the hearts
of men. God is my guide, Hallelujah! So what care I
that I am shut out from the temples of those who call themselves
the righteous? The world is too small a church for
me. Through the tall timbers of humanity I hunt immortal
souls. Look out for me, you quaking quail of a woman!
Look out for me, you running rabbit of a man! You can’t
escape me through the underbrush of your hypocrisy. I
don’t miss, once I take aim. Hallelujah, I am gunning for
<i>you</i>!”</p>

<p>Lest the imp mistake his dishonest amusement, Satan cut
off the report. “Enough of that irreverent stuff. Listen
carefully now to instructions from the First and Last. That
liner likely will wait for a man of Cabot’s importance. See
that you get aboard with him. You’re to closer-than-a-brother
him through an opportunity for inciting cowardice
which will present itself. While he sleeps insinuate into
his mind a terror of death by falling and by drowning.
Strengthen his primal appetence of self-protection. This
is the last chance you get with me. If you fail to make an
arrant coward of this man you’ll find yourself out of a
deviling job for death. I am busy now, as you’d better be.
A bad afternoon to you!”</p>

<p>The Regent of Reversals was “on terms” with the elements,
as with all forces for evil through good. On hearing
that calm had been planned for the high-seas, he discarded
the idea of a marine storm.</p>

<p>Always had his worst results been obtained through natural
causes. Indeed, he had come to pride himself that no
cause was <i>too</i> natural for him. Particularly did he dislike,
for reasons of his own, to interfere with a rainbow, it being
a symbol to him that the Earth would not be destroyed by
water. Since he had only fire as a weapon he would be in a
bad fix if the coup ultimate should be sprung upon him with
water power. Of course, the coup wasn’t to be sprung,
not if he could forestall it, but even yet he was wracked
by unrighteous rage every time he recalled Noah’s Flood.
That time, he had been about as powerful as a case of dynamite&mdash;<i>soaked</i>.
One decent thing about the Great-I-Am was
that He never forgot a promise. One could count upon
a rainbow, once one saw it. And Satan was “counting.”</p>

<p>Upon the single great indestructible under his control he
must depend to vary the monotony of a placid sea. Never
had the three single-eyed Cyclopeans of mythology failed to
serve his purposes. Lightning Flash, Thunderbolt and
Rolling Thunder would advance his scheme.</p>

<p>Motivation and “natural causes” arranged, he sent a peremptory
summons for the Prime Minister and to him detailed
instructions in the duties of a proxy escort. An hour before
dawn Sin was to awaken the Royal Entertainer and conduct
her straightway to the stadium of the Ball of Life. That
“best bubble” of infernal invention was to entertain her by
picturing some interesting Earth events as they occurred.</p>

<p>“I shall not fail Your Damnity,” the old toady assured
him.</p>

<p>“Better not,” was all Satan said as he finger-flashed his
First Emissary of Evil out the royal suite.</p>

<p>His Master Crier was called; told to issue a general invitation
to the forthcoming spectacle; warned that the stadium
must be filled to its last seat, despite the unconventional
hour. Not until this sop to his vanity had been applied,
did His Lowness close the “office” and himself depart.</p>

<p>With the failure of his past-tense picture-play in mind,
he betook himself to the stadium and preparations for this
greatest and latest show under Earth. There must be no
miscues about a performance upon which depended the
success of that “experiment” inspired by Dolores’ earth-tales
of joys, as well as griefs to men. He would make his own
tests of the complicated apparatus, although the plant had
not failed him since installation.</p>

<p>To establish that the Ball of Life functioned properly
was his first concern. Giving it a turn, he watched the
reflector pool for shadows. When the shimmering prisms
of the mercury-like pond had been quieted, he was rewarded
by an intimate look at a naval review somewhere on the
China Sea, within focus of which the overhung ball had
chanced to stop.</p>

<p>The finder he next put to test. This instrument, of graduated
tubes like those of a monster telescope, controlled the
lenses of the all-seeing ball. At will, he caused it to pick
up this scene and that, finally locating the dirigible which
was to be the central figure of the forthcoming event, as it
tossed on waves of air above the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Closer attention did he give to the aurograph, a practicable
device worked out to supplement the spectroscope, which
combined on an enormous scale the principles of the radio-telephone
and the phonograph. Back of the stadium, well
out of way of the suspended ball, the antennæ&mdash;an elaborate
network of wires&mdash;were suspended by metal-like balloons.
These were insulated from Gehenna, except for the central
converging wires, which led to multi-power generators.
Upon a huge sounding board were the messages received,
thence communicated to the stadium by annunciators. The
tuning of this masterpiece of etheric control occasioned
Satan some concern, but finally was accomplished to his
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Back on the control platform, surrounded by his technical
chiefs, His Highness watched the stadium fill. As the appointed
hour approached, he ran up the green walls which
surrounded the terraced seats and from the pool flashed an
order that all spectators adjust the small dynamos of the
eye-shades with which they were provided on entering. He
wished none to fail to see to the end the abasement of
John Cabot.</p>

<p>A moment he hesitated, then took up the telephone connected
with the royal box. The lackadaisical voice of Old
Original responded.</p>

<p>“Dame Dolores in her place?”</p>

<p>On being assured of that important fact, he turned to the
Master Mechanic.</p>

<p>“Step on the music!”</p>

<p>Upon all ears burst an orchestration, The Song of the
Sea. As surely did they hear it as though it had been
carried hellward by the wind through shells, crevasses and
metallic splinters. As by lutes and æeolean harps it was
played, with crashes and staccato rumblings for bass.</p>

<p>The drama of mortal cowardice, destined to turn into
contempt a too-long-lasting love, was on.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</h3>
</div>

<p>Day lifts from her couch of mists to awaken betimes
the Sea, her slumbering lord.</p>

<p>Last evening he had ordered her from his presence, as
usual ashamed that she should witness his embrace of that
mistress of his passions, Night, who incites him to the
blackest of his crimes. Yet this morning she tiptoes down to
his vast chamber, pale and sleepy-eyed in her diaphanous
<i>peignoir</i>, there to hover over him, eager and fearful to give
the early call.</p>

<p>Will he arise blustering, splash about in his bath and
growl forenoon complaints at her until she can no longer
smile&mdash;until she further angers him with tears? Or will
his mood be equable? Will he respond to her sunny smiles
and the sweet-zephyred nothings which she best knows to
whisper in his ear?</p>

<p>Amiable enough he looks. But then, amiability usually
characterizes the sleep of his billowy sort of spouse. Subconsciously
he must have heard her step, for he sighs, tosses
restlessly and flings up shapeless arms as though to enfold
her.</p>

<p>Forgiveness flushes Day’s cheeks, her finger-tips, her
dainty toes. Forgiveness is the power by which, through
the blisses and tribulations of æons of their marital state,
she has remained his dearest love and inspiration. It has
kept her face fresh as when, in their infancy, the Great
Minister made them one. It has enabled her to forget his
brutalities of yesterday in the hope of kindness to-day.</p>

<p>Never comes a morn without much for them to do. For
him there are ships to be tided from shore to shore, flying
things of the air to be cradled when in need of rest, myriads
of monsters and minnows to be fed, shells, pearls and
corals to fashion in his spare time. And she never rests
from dawn to dark in her effort to keep the sky clear that
she may smile something of her own vitality into all living
things under her eye, be they fishes of the sea, fowl of the
air, or man from the various islands which so irritate her
irascible consort.</p>

<p>All looks well for her now, unless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>An over-shoulder glance she casts about the horizon.
There is an ominous look over there, a somewhat darker
speck against the banks of gray. Are her archest enemies,
the trio of fire-eyed Cyclops, planning interference with the
mercies of her upper air?</p>

<p>No matter what portends, she must awaken her lord.
Usually he scowls for hours should she be late about his
call. Forcing a smile, she droops over him until, with bride-like
ardor, she kisses him on the lips. A moment his watery
eyes gaze into hers. Then he gulps from pleasure at the
desirable sight of her; lurches toward her; makes a clutch
at her scant draperies.</p>

<p>But not for a moment does she allow herself to be caught
to his moist, palpitant breast. Something immediate demands
her attention. She makes excuse&mdash;a monster beetle
without wings then appearing from the direction of land.
With sweet-soft adjurations that her lazy old Sea fall not
again into a doze, she hurries to meet and greet the gleaming
thing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nothing had Dolores seen of the dirigibles of Earth, save
far-up glimpses of those which occasionally passed over her
New York. Now, with amaze, she noted the proportions of
the air-liner which had intruded into the reflection of dawn
at sea. In the wan light, it looked to surpass the largest
ocean steamship she had seen and held its course steadily,
as though its blunt nose were cleaving waves of water,
rather than of atmosphere. Through the slow rise of the
sun an idea of its speed was given.</p>

<p>Silver-jacketed it was, cigar-shaped and massively concrete
on its atmospheric track. Her credulity was taxed,
however, to realize that this at which she gazed was no vision,
such as that dreamed by Kipling in “The Night Mail,” but a
scene of the moment in the mortal world. Actual as though
she were watching from some anchored ship nearby were
the colors of the wingless beetle and the very vaguest tints
of water and sky.</p>

<p>As the aluminum-painted envelope seemed about to pass
from sight across the rim of the prismatic pool, some shift
of the reflecting machinery refound it and gave a closer
view. The deck was shown, studded with cabins and protected
by shields of glass. Although lacking the width of
the modern ocean vessel, it was comfortably roomy, to judge
by the steamer chairs being placed about for late-sleeping
passengers. As an assurance that this was no cinematograph
picture, the sailor figures engaged did not move about with
the artificial speed which so often discounts the realism of
the film, but with that deliberation and casualness peculiar
to the life which is realer than “reel.”</p>

<p>“Some jump from the day when they flew wooden kites
over oil engines, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>At Sin’s question, the girl-shade glanced around into that
map of malignity, his face. “Too wonderful almost to believe.
In the air, truly, a man must feel like the monarch of
all he surveys.”</p>

<p>“Untruly, he <i>thinks</i> he is.”</p>

<p>The interruption came from behind. Turning, they saw
that His Majesty had entered the box. His frown suggested
nerve tension, rather than ill temper. His voice was oiled
with triumph over the demonstration of his most unique
invention. Nevertheless the accented word of his comment
aroused in Dolores the uneasiness which had kept pace
with them through his personally-conducted tour of Greater
Gehenna.</p>

<p>Directly on seating himself, he reached for the telephone.
“Don’t waste all day on scenics. This is no travelogue. Get
to the interiors!”</p>

<p>Tapping the box-rail so impatiently that sulphurous spots
glowed from the points of contact, he watched the pool.
Dolores and the iniquitous escort on her other side awaited
with interest the result of his command.</p>

<p>Soon they were viewing a luxuriously appointed stateroom.
The full-length brass bedstead was occupied by a
sleeping man. His up-thrown, silk-clad arm concealed the
lower part of his face, but his forehead and back-tossed
hair showed clearly.</p>

<p>“<i>John!</i>” The muffled exclamation escaped the girl-shade,
half a sob, half a croon of joy.</p>

<p>A vaguer male figure became discernible, seated near the
head of the bed. Leaning over the pillow, he whispered to
the man. Although his outlines developed somewhat to the
gaze, he continued to lack the clarity of other objects about
the cabin; impressed one more as a creature of the spirit
than the flesh.</p>

<p>The sleeper seemed to feel this insinuating presence. He
turned as if in troubled dreams; covered his ears with his
hands; drew away so stressfully that his head bumped a
bedpost. He awakened; dazedly looked about; glanced at
his watch; decided to arise.</p>

<p>This evidently was a prefatory scene. There ensued an
interval which Satan occupied with issuing detailed orders
for the further manipulation of the great reflector. When
the over-grown “blimp” again was mirrored in the pool, the
lapse of time at once was manifest. Several passengers
paced the deck and below breakfast was underway. In the
lee of one of the cabins, a woman, richly clad in furs, was
being tucked into her chair by a fur-coated man wearing a
plaid cap.</p>

<p>“D’Elie still with Catherine!” exclaimed Dolores with
resentment.</p>

<p>“And with John Cabot aboard. My latest in the infernal
triangle,” His Highness pointed pridefully. “Note that they
have foregone all pretense of the love-making that used to
engage them, these two who are agreed to exchange a title
for a dot when husband sees fit to dot the matrimonial
dash.”</p>

<p>Distress widened the spirit-girl’s eyes. “But the sanctity
of marriage&mdash;have they never a thought for that?”</p>

<p>“The sanctity of <i>what</i>?” He leered at Sin. “Our lady
of many griefs to men to remind us of that! May she never
lose her knack of amusing us!” He eyed her with an
affectation of old-school sanctimony. “Alack, my poor child,
the sanctity of marriage <i>ain’t</i>! And even if it were, these
two wouldn’t wish their future relationship hampered by
such an obsolete notion. He looks to be gassing about the
gas of the dirigible, from the way he’s pointing above their
heads. Manlike, he probably is trying to excite her admiration
for his knowledge of how it is filled with helium contained
in bags of gold-beater’s skin. Helium, permit me to
inform you, is an idea that earthlings borrowed from the
Sun. It is supposed to be an incombustible gas. Notice
that the French bounder is smoking an after-breakfast
cigar.”</p>

<p>“And is it really safe?” Anxiety quickened Dolores’
voice.</p>

<p>“<i>Really?</i> Hast never been struck by the comparativeness
of reality? Nothing is really real except eternal life and
that doesn’t even <i>sound</i> real.”</p>

<p>Certainly Satan knew the value of pause. In silence he
watched with them the shift of scene to where John Cabot,
alone as a celebrity can be in a crowd of sycophantic fellow
passengers, paced the deck. With John’s eyes, their own
lifted to the air-liner’s Milky Way toward Europe, where
a bank of clouds darkened the course.</p>

<p>“Now for something doing”&mdash;Sin to Dolores. “Take a
bet with me. Will they beat the storm or the storm beat
them?”</p>

<p>She, however, was intent on a repeated question: “You
are sure, Your Lowness, that they are safe in trusting to
helium?”</p>

<p>“It is safe to say that they <i>think</i> they are.”</p>

<p>His reply was abstracted. After searching the scene
intently, he turned again to the telephone. “I have keen long-distance
eyes, trained to pierce the Plutonian shore, but I
can’t see a blur of that imp Okeh. I must wireless him a
reminder of where personal devils go that get too impersonal.”</p>

<p>He spared an apology to Dolores. “Don’t be hurt if I
look a bit absent-minded at times. You are so unselfish
that you won’t, I am sure, when you remember how much
other, if less fair, fiends, often need an inspiriting thought
from me.”</p>

<p>As the pilot drove the great dirigible straight at the sky-scowl
contesting its right-of-way, the winds hurled at it
bank after bank of inky clouds. Huddled against the blasts
behind the forward wind glass, the fifty or more passengers
showed with as many variations their heirship to the flesh.
The beautiful Mrs. Cabot could be seen loosing the hold
on her arm of her French suitor and staggering across the
deck to where her husband stood apart. Despite his concerned
look, he tried to reassure her. All showed relief
when the captain appeared among them, his little daughter
by the hand, and laughed at the idea of danger. His gestures
pointed the fact that the storm was passing well over their
trig craft.</p>

<p>“Confident little monarchs of the air, eh?”</p>

<p>Satan’s chuckle announced that his attention, too, was on
the pool play. Before Dolores could formulate the plea
commanded by her fears, he returned to the telephone with
a curt command that increased her uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Now, Cyclops, blast them with a look! Strike at the
heart of their conceit. Show them the noncombustibility of
helium. Punish them for flaunting the control of the Prince
of the Power of the Air! Strike&mdash;<i>strike</i>!”</p>

<p>He lurched back to the rail; with the interested minister
and the dismayed girl-shade, leaned far out that he might
miss no resultant detail of the electric storm due. And
straightway, from out the tumbled mass of blackness flashed
a three-forked streak of light. Directly at the great gas
bag it struck; with each prong of the fork pierced the gold-beater’s
skin. Next second, from three of the separated
safety compartments, fluttered fiery flags.</p>

<p>Wounded, the great beetle strove on against the odds of
flames licking its envelope body with avid tongues. Soon
the captain realized the futility of any race against time
along the unmarked course of the upper air. The powerful
engines stopped. The propellers ceased to revolve. The
liner wavered in mid-air, as shown when the streamers of
smoke ceased to trail out behind and gradually straightened
toward the cloud bank.</p>

<p>No slightest move was made to fight the fire above. Evidently
an order to abandon ship had been passed. Officers
and crew busied themselves with such life-saving apparatus
as had been provided against so unlikely a contingency.
Gas was turned into the baby blimps carried by the dirigible
in lieu of life-boats. Outward they were swung.</p>

<p>On deck the hapless humans could be seen struggling
toward posts of vantage, fighting back their dearest and
best, forgetting to pray in the panic of this conflagration a
thousand feet above the comparative safety of the sea. A
refractory engine might have been coped with. An explosion
of the hydrogen gas used in earlier ships of air would have
been understood and the worst been over in one fatal blast.
But this slow, gruesome bonfire of the helium on which
they had relied, these æon-long minutes jeopardizing the
primal, inalienable right&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The deck was beginning to sag. Two of the aërial life-boats
had been swung downward and loaded with women and
the ship’s only listed child&mdash;the captain’s motherless daughter.
Like bubbles, they were given to the mercies of the air.</p>

<p>The observation spread that there would not be room in
the basket of the last baby-blimp for all who remained. An
under-officer started to pass out the suits which were parachutes
and life-preservers combined&mdash;suits calculated to lower
one through a quarter-mile of atmosphere and provide support
upon the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>Came realization that there were not enough of the parachutes
to go around. Self-first madness gained control. A
battle for possession of the safety devices began.</p>

<p>The spirit-girl, watching this spectacle from the perspective
of Gehenna, grew faint.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t endure to look a moment more!”</p>

<p>Shuddering, she sank back from sight of the catastrophe.
But she felt the hands torn from her eyes and heard a sword-sharp
command.</p>

<p>“Can’t? You’ve <i>got</i> to look to the end!”</p>

<p>The ferocity with which His Highness forced her to the
rail ended in an anticipatory chuckle as he saw that the
focus of the incredible reflectors had narrowed upon the
imperiled passengers.</p>

<p>There was Catherine Cabot, already equipped with a parachute,
crowding forward to board the last of the blimp-boats.
There was the Marquis d’Elie, checked in his regardless
struggle for a life-preserver and restrained in the grip of a
couple of sailors by the captain’s orders. And there was
John Cabot, standing to one side, calmer than the rest,
despite the dread realization on his face of the fact that there
would not be escape for all.</p>

<p>A place had been saved for Catherine in the boat. She
did not need the parachute suit. John saw and his face
showed inner contention. If he was to stand back from
the boat, should he not have the chance of that superfluous
life-preserver? A moment longer he stood irresolute, confusedly
brushing a hand across his forehead. As if to shut
out some sinister suggestion, he turned up his ulster collar.</p>

<p>Perhaps the super-acute imaginations of the spirit audience
surpassed sight. Perhaps they actually saw an evil face
lean to the ear of the mortal and heard the voice of the
millionaire’s own of the personal devils that improve such
moments to incite the worst in everyman.</p>

<p>John’s attempt to deny the disputation of fear and selfishness,
although brief in point of time, was intense. While
still in the throes he saw that another had noted Catherine’s
double protection.</p>

<p>The Marquis d’Elie, abandoned by his guards, was rushing
toward her, his object plain. His jaw hung lax as he
reached and importuned her. His knees near failed him in
the struggle to take the parachute by force.</p>

<p>And Catherine? With all her strength she fought off the
abject beggar who so recently had played the nobleman.
Yet when, as almost he had conquered her, she saw her husband
bearing down upon them, a retroactive impulse controlled
her. So John, too, was after the saving suit? If she
must give up the second chance of life, which she had
meant to hold in reserve, it should not be to John!</p>

<p>When the banker engaged d’Elie, she allied herself with
the defense. No breath of the ignited helium was more
fiery than the invective she spat at him who so long had
supplied her with the luxuries of life.</p>

<p>When she saw that his strength was likely to worst the
two of them, she suddenly drew out of the struggle and
herself unfastened the contested parachute. As d’Elie was
flung aside, she flung it to him. Turning swiftly, she then
threw herself upon her husband and begged that he assist
her into the overloaded baby-blimp, about to be cut away.
Herself safe, she saw his attempt to follow forcibly prevented
by the pilot and shrieked with mirthless spite. It
would seem that in this hour when all loves were crowded
out save that of self, hate was well remembered.</p>

<p>“Now watch the Cabot coward!”</p>

<p>His Majesty’s sharp suggestion stabbed the spirit-girl’s
heart. She tried to turn from a sadder sight than the air
craft’s consumption&mdash;the burning to ashes of her fondest
ideal. Yet she might not turn; might not close her eyes.
A control stronger than her own aversion was upon her.
In trying not to look, she realized that she must look until
the end.</p>

<p>The loudening laughter of the vast audience deadened her
consciousness; seemed to be at her, rather than the spectacle
that so diverted them. She sought to fortify herself. What
though John did turn coward? The flesh was heir to the
fear of death. At each apologetic thought, the mirth of the
helliot crowd crackled louder. What could be happening
on the doomed craft so to delight them? With a dread
for the spiritual debasement of her loved one of Earth
greater than had been her own dread of physical death, she
looked and looked.</p>

<p>The baby-blimp of last resource was lowering toward the
doubtful safety of the surface of the sea. The pilot stood on
the bridge, idle for the first time since the gas-bag had
been struck. Evidently he expected to go down with his
ship as had so many captains before him. John Cabot clung
to the deck rail as if contemplating a suicidal plunge. Forward,
the Marquis d’Elie stood equipped with the parachute
suit won by Catherine’s trick, but a lack of trust in it seemed
to restrain him from the life-leap.</p>

<p>Too long he hesitated. John Cabot, maddened anew by
sight of the Frenchman’s superior chance, leaped the space
between them; from behind dragged him down on the blistering
deck. There followed a brief struggle&mdash;an exchange of
attacks, a roll <i>en masse</i> and the separation of a knock-out
blow from John. As his fingers loosened the last buckle of
the safety suit, the craft gave a violent lurch. The foreigner’s
unconscious form, far heavier than air, was flung
over the rail to a drop from which there could be no
awakening.</p>

<p>As the air-liner straightened for the last time, John Cabot
released the clutch that by a narrow margin had saved him
from following d’Elie and got to his feet. A glance at the
blazing bag above, their one support, convinced him that
seconds were precious. His eyes, however, lowering, met
the level, contemptuous gaze of the pilot.</p>

<p>The soul of Dolores shuddered with shame for the man
she would have sworn to be brave. Then awoke in her that
mothering, protective instinct which lives in women long
after pride has been crucified. There still might be time
to save John against himself. Remembrance of her own
reluctance to turn on the jets that last evening on earth
filled her heart with mercy. She would risk appeal to the
Master Mind.</p>

<p>“I am sickened with this spectacle, sire. Human nature is
strong, but not so strong as you. Show your power by
throttling this Okeh devil and conquering the mortal’s mood.
Come, I challenge you!”</p>

<p>When she turned to enforce the argument, she saw that
His Highness had not heard. The visible of him was
lurched back in his seat, enraged determination on the face,
lips set in a snarl, fiend fingers clutching the high forehead.
But that which had made him Prince of the Power of the
Air&mdash;his dauntless determination&mdash;had gone from him.</p>

<p>Dolores did not need to be told what had happened. Impatient
lest John Cabot’s personal devil should fail, Satan
had projected his own spirit to take in charge the mortal’s
fall. His will, not John’s, had incited that struggle for the
life-suit. He would accomplish his worst. The conviction
moved her mouth in a suppressed sob. Drawn by the
ghoulish fascination that makes earthlings cling to the clay
of their dead, she clung to the balustrade and strained her
eyes toward the pool.</p>

<p>Death is the mortgage on life. John Cabot’s revolt against
payment showed in his face. Craven impulses clutched him.
At his ear were the lips of the Master Insinuator. Facile
fingers seemed to aid his with the parachute buckles. Yet
he had seen himself in the pilot’s contempt. He was putting
up a fight. His life-long habit of self-respect was strong.
The pilot was father to a motherless child&mdash;a girl. He should
be saved.</p>

<p>With the Thing which had attacked him&mdash;the fiend called
Fear&mdash;John grappled. His knees shook, his jaw sagged, his
eyes bulged from the fetid suggestions which, evidently, were
gassing his will. If the pilot went down with the air-craft,
he never could tell.</p>

<p>Dolores, too, shook with fear. She knew what John did
not know&mdash;just who was opposing him. Indignation over
the unequal struggle steadied her; cleared her thoughts.
Why was all the power given to sin and none to rightness?
By what method had the Foul Fiend projected his spirit to
Earth to slay the courage of the man she would have
suffered any death to save? Surely, what could be done
for evil purposes could be done for good! Why was will
given to woman if not to augment the will of man&mdash;why
her mite of strength if not to incite greater strength? John
needed her.</p>

<p>From fear lest he fail was born determination that he
win. He was a good and great man, John Cabot. He had
lived aright and deserved so to die. The hate of Hell was
not stronger than the love of her heart. What The Destroyer
had done, she&mdash;John’s savior&mdash;also must do.</p>

<p>Moved beyond realization of the spaces between them,
Dolores sprang to her feet and sounded into the upper spaces
the vibrant chord of inspiration:</p>

<p>“<i>John, be love-worthy!</i>”</p>

<p>Regardless of the astonished stares directed her way, she
saw in the mercurized pool that he bent his head as if listening&mdash;that
his lips moved. She seized the telephone which
Satan had used in communicating with the control platform.
To the voice that answered she commanded:</p>

<p>“Get a record of what he said&mdash;I <i>must</i> know what he
said!”</p>

<p>Lifted out of herself by her success, she leaned over the
balustrade and willed that he should win.</p>

<p>And as she waited the battle on deck was fought to its
finish. Self-mastered, John brushed from his ears the insinuations
that had tempted him; controlled the fingers fumbling
with the buckles; turned back the feet struggling toward
the rail.</p>

<p>As the helium from the last compartments waved skyward
the flames of the dirigible’s final support, he stripped off
the life-saving jacket and forced it upon the pilot. His
insistence clearly was in the name of that girl-child who
would be orphaned should her father desert her for a scruple.
He urged his protesting fellow-human to the rail; helped him
over-side. In magnificent calm he watched the silken folds
of the parachute spread open under their burden and begin
a gentle, oceanward descent.</p>

<p>As the gas bag disintegrated, bits of burning embers
became detached and dropped like spent rockets to the waves.
John Cabot, left alone on the deck, stood ready for the end.</p>

<p>The while, his last utterance, demanded by her who had
inspired him, was given to the vast throng through the
annunciators connected with the master telephonograph.
Deep, strong, triumphant, its first syllable silenced the orchestral
Song of the Sea. A cry of victory, it shamed demon
laughter and tortured the souls of the lost with regrets over
the god-great powers they might have come to wield had
they but won their fights. A requiem that rang through
the crusts of two worlds was its single word:</p>

<p>“<i>Dolores!</i>”</p>

<p>Exactly how she made her descent from the royal box and
reached the edge of the pool, the girl-shade never knew.
The sound of John’s voice had moved her with but one
wish&mdash;to join him.</p>

<p>He had, then, heard her cry&mdash;had answered her! So near
he seemed to her that she could not endure to be so far
from him.</p>

<p>Aspen-eager, she leaned far over the edge of the great
bowl that held the mercury. But all she saw was the reflection
of her own face. The dirigible must have gone sputtering
into the sea while she was making her descent. Her
lover must have met his mortal fate. The pool had finished
its story.</p>

<p>So compelling had been the realism of its reflected scenes
that she still was controlled by the emotion they had aroused.
She felt lured almost beyond the strength of her intelligence
to throw herself into the brilliant depths&mdash;to be clasped as
she might have been in that realer sea in beloved arms. So
low she bent that her whisper rippled the surface.</p>

<p>“John ... <i>John</i>.”</p>

<p>A satirical voice, even more than the clutch of withered,
hands drew her back to the now of Gehenna. The minister
had followed her and was blinking at her, a trace of responsibility
mapped on the parchment of his face.</p>

<p>“Another second and Sin himself couldn’t have saved you
to Hell,” he exclaimed. “Don’t you know that this swimming
pool is bottomless? Are you trying to hang one of
those griefs of yours on me?”</p>

<p>His reproach was a revelation to the girl. Even Old
Original! Never, perhaps, had she felt more puzzled to
meet overture of male. But she was spared reply. The
aggressiveness slackened from his form. A look of craft
wiped the reproach from his face. He stepped behind her.</p>

<p>Explanation came in the approach of The Tempter.
His spirit, then, had returned from its projection to Earth
to the shell of him left in the box. Impulsively she hurried
to meet him. She had no consideration to spare for his
chagrin over having failed in his personal attempt. Too
exalted in pride was she to give thought to the effect on
him of pride’s fall. Forward she stretched both hands, as
if for the congratulation of a friend.</p>

<p>“That favor I asked of you&mdash;I’ve granted it myself!” she
exclaimed. “There is no need for me to go to him. He will
come now to me.”</p>

<p>She felt her fingers caught in a cruel grasp. Her joy-dewed
glance was scorched by his malevolence.</p>

<p>Back drew the sneering lips over white, fang-like teeth.
“You really think he’ll draw a ticket down here&mdash;that hero?
Fool, you have too much faith in the judgments of men!”</p>

<p>With repression more ominous than any outburst could
have been, he turned on his heel.</p>

<p>“Come home,” he said.</p>

<p>As has so many a submissive woman soul before her,
Dolores tried to hide within her heart her blissful expectation.
But she trod on air as she followed out of the stadium.</p>

<p>Splendidly John had gone through the formality of lifting
the mortgage contracted at his birth&mdash;that debt of life put
upon all, which may be paid only in the coinage of death.</p>

<p>Soon, now, he would come to her.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</h3>
</div>

<p>It was “afterward.” There could be no doubt of that.
His Highness, so far as Dolores was concerned, had retired
into one of his silences. He must be enraged with her for
her interference in the pool play. But for what could he
be waiting?</p>

<p>True, the concession for which she had offered to pay
any price was no longer an issue. There was no need now
for her to be put in spirit connection with Earth, even had
she not discovered that her own concentrated will could
accomplish the projection&mdash;that the dead might return to
their quondam surroundings, ruling and being ruled through
senses stronger far than physical. Could she sooner have
realized this of the strange laws which governed her present
state of existence, what heart-hurts of foreboding and regret
she might have spared John and herself!</p>

<p>Not for an hour of the days and nights since the failure
of that “Greatest Show” had she forgotten that the time
set for her own answer as to her fate was approaching. On
this afternoon&mdash;the sixth of those allotted “seven days of
disgrace”&mdash;she felt herself no nearer decision than before
the end of her séances.</p>

<p>She tried not to dread. Dread shriveled the soul; would
mar her progress. And she was determined now to progress,
despite her sentence to Gehenna. Hope was the immortal
soul of love. Once John had joined her, no law of the lowlands
could kill their hope.</p>

<p>So the girl-shade was happy in her deplorable state as she
never had been happy when the gateway of the mortal world
had opened to her youthful tread. He whom she loved loved
her. That was the lyric of her song of the soul. Deep-chording
into the accompaniment was her absolute knowledge
of his worthiness. Expectancy played a running obbligato
through each measure, with here and there a trill of
errant joy. He was coming, John; must by now be nearing
the end of that long, drear journey from Earth to Shadow
Land.</p>

<p>Every hour helped now. From far away, whispers of the
altruistic philosophy she had taught young Jack Cabot penetrated
her moods. How better prepare for the eventualities
of to-morrow than by good cheer to-day? Since all the
to-morrows must come disguised as to-days, she would make
the best of the here and now.</p>

<p>A bit advanced were such ideas for the shell-pink ear of
her infant, yet to the wee-shade she murmured them this
late afternoon while out for a stroll. Although Adeline
accompanied her, she herself carried the spirit-child to save
the maid’s pride.</p>

<p>Their practice had been to take their evening walks
through the Garden of Bad Luck. To-day, for the first
time Dolores chose the Avenue of Locusts, which led from
the palace direct to the Limbian Gates. The ex-great lady
protested against walking beside her mistress, even when
ordered to do so, on the plea that she must work out her
term of degradation. The young mother’s hopeful adjurations
to the instinct-fretted babe seemed only to increase her
bitterness.</p>

<p>How could m’lady benefit, Adeline demanded in French,
even though her lover did come through the gates that eventide?
Her own husband’s pretense to care for her was only
the last-lingering impulse of self-protection. He was assuming
the virtue of constancy though he had it not. But
he would rue the attempt, since he was insulting, not only
her intelligence but that of the Mind Prince as well. M’lady
must remember the rule of the realm; must clear her mind
of the heresy of earthly ideals, lest they become known and
she punished therefor. She would be saved a shock could
she but realize beforehand that the lover she had loved
would hate her even as she him. In Gehenna he and she
who had caused each other’s fall would be, indeed, bad met.</p>

<p>“See yonder warehouse beyond the wall?” Adeline pointed
out a low structure. “There is checked all such superfluous
baggage as love. Only hate may be brought within.”</p>

<p>Dolores wondered that so small a building could store
the lingering loves of the Hadean hordes. Before she could
comment, there came to them from the entrance of the wireless
station just inside the gate a high shriek rent by a deeper
staccato of laughter. Down the steps and directly into her
path came rolling what looked an oversized foot-ball. Close
followed His Evil Majesty himself. In one hand he waved
a knout with snapping lashes. The laughter was his and
more cruel than his instrument of torture.</p>

<p>After handing over her babe to Adeline and commanding
a quick retreat, Dolores hurried toward the ball, which
was unwinding as it rolled. Its arms, legs and head proved
to belong to a male <i>manes</i>, terrified beyond coherency. By
the time Satan reached them with knout upraised, she had
pushed the wretch behind her and started him after the
noble-maid. Beyond a stinging of her consciousness, she
did not feel the blow that fell. Almost at once she recovered;
was able to face His Highness with calm inquiry.</p>

<p>“What has he done to deserve this attack?”</p>

<p>“<i>Done?</i>” Satan’s voice crackled as had the whip.
“Shouldn’t the chief inter-world operator know better than
to retail me bad tidings? Out of my way&mdash;I’m highly
charged!”</p>

<p>“No.” Dolores stood firm.</p>

<p>“You’d rather I’d experiment on you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Best look out, unless you want to be blinded until Judgment.”</p>

<p>She was able to disregard the Boss Bully’s warning by
centering her mind upon her great happiness. <i>He had been
love-worthy, John.</i></p>

<p>“You can’t strike me blind,” she said.</p>

<p>Into the confidence of the purple-black eyes uplifted to
his Satan scowled.</p>

<p>“You’d not be blind. You’d only think you were because
I say so and my mind is stronger than yours. Everything
is a thought down here, as you must have learned ere this&mdash;just
a bad thought.” With the lash in mid-air he added:
“But, thank me, you can’t kill a bad thought.”</p>

<p>As her hair was lifting to the magnet of the knout, he
dropped it. The respite, however, was not for mercy’s sake.</p>

<p>“You didn’t change expression. You don’t cringe.
Why?”</p>

<p>“Pain is a coward’s thought. I know that you, Augustness,
cannot hurt me.”</p>

<p>Interestedly he contemplated her and this, her first open
defiance. “You’re smarter than I thought. You have a
certain regardlessness that is the next-best thing to conscious
power.”</p>

<p>“I have,” she said, “faith that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Faith?</i>” he jeered. “Then I have it, too&mdash;faith that I’ll
do my damnedest. I cannot hurt you physically, no. But
I hold a record for hurting minds that may cause you to
reconsider.”</p>

<p>“Not while I believe that all will be well with me.” The
voice of her contention sounded like the balmy winds of
spring, to which nor man nor devil may say nay.</p>

<p>Perhaps her glance toward the gates suggested the source
of her beatitude. Perhaps he sensed it from his own irritation.
He passed her point to level one of his own.</p>

<p>“And has this belief absolute padded your senses against
the fact that I am displeased with you, she-fool? Don’t
worry. I never let personal prejudice interfere with The
Cause. This faith-theory is valuable with the reverse English
put on it. As a science, it has done considerable harm
to the religions of the world. I’ve been waiting until your
week was up. Why not have it now&mdash;your answer?”</p>

<p>“My answer to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To my indecent proposition that you organize the vice
of womanhood. Are you going to take that Low Priestess
job?”</p>

<p>“I have until to-morrow to decide.”</p>

<p>“True. And you hope meantime that your love-hound
will come barking at our Avernian door. Oh, don’t deny
it! Why else should you be hanging ’round the gates? Why
else should I?”</p>

<p>“But you said the judgments of men would never send a
hero here.”</p>

<p>Stooping to recover his electric lash, Satan used it to
punctuate his reply. “I’m hoping against hope, just as you
are. If only he would be sent this way&mdash;<i>ah!</i> My latest
wireless from Earth, however, leads me to fear not. The
newspapers are headlined with his heroism. Imbecile earthlings
are going to erect a memorial to him. And, would you
believe it, that hunting parson of yours has used your friend’s
death as a stepping-stone out of the muddle-puddle of his
ecclesiastical disrepute? With Cabot as his text, he preached
to thousands in Central Park, exampling himself through the
viciously attacked philanthropist who, although proved guilty
of weakness of the flesh, rose to the moral strength of a god
in an emergency. Get the idea? His plea is for all men
who have been dragged down by women. Should not he
know that Cabot was too greatly tried, since the same she-devil
ruined him with his church? You recognize the
allusion? The prayers he sent up for the soul of his fellow
victim were indirectly for himself. As a result he is to
head the new Church of the Broad-Minded. Could you
beat it&mdash;or him?”</p>

<p>At her consternation, he chuckled enjoyably.</p>

<p>“How the people of Earth like to bunk themselves! But
you look fogged. Is your faith getting cured? Care to come
into the receiving room and sit while you wait? I left some
unfinished business.”</p>

<p>As they mounted the steps of the stone-like structure,
he added a mental lash to her punishment.</p>

<p>“You remember, of course, the lawyer who lost Mrs.
Cabot’s divorce case? Last you saw of him, in ‘The Turn-Turtle,’
he was being thrown out of his profession for mal-practicing
that delicate art called ‘double-crossing.’ The
timely birth of your ill-begot, with fatherhood pinned on
John Cabot by Seff’s testimony and the guilty admission of
your suicide, was a-plenty and to spare to ruin Rufus Holt.
But along comes that judge you tricked, Roscoe Strang, of
the good-sport tie. He has Holt’s case re-opened and carries
through a daring example of man-to-man friendliness.”</p>

<p>From his belt he took the paper-like slip on which wireless
messages were sent down by Gehennan operators.</p>

<p>“Let’s see just what he testified, this brotherly judge.
Oh yes; ‘The accused did bring the Trent girl to me, but
to let me judge of her guilt. She looked so pure that I
was not convinced and stood, as I stand now, on my right
to judge. If fault there was, that fault was mine.’ After
that, there was nothing for the Bar Association to do but
open their arms to the brother they had misjudged.”</p>

<p>“I am glad,” Dolores said. “For a time I blamed Rufus
Holt for my sufferings. But he tried to be a true friend
to John.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” sneered Satan as he opened the station door,
“and made a mess of it, as true friends usually do. At that,
you’ve got a good start with him and can use him in our
new campaign.”</p>

<p>Within, an operator wearing a receiving head-dress, sat
among his instruments. Beside a window which commanded
a view of the entrance, His Highness placed a chair for her.</p>

<p>“The gates will open soon,” he advised. “Watch the new
arrivals trickle in and call me in case you catch sight of
your John. I am pardonably impatient to meet him.”</p>

<p>To sink into the chair was a relief. At sight of the preparations
outside which the pigmy ushers were making for the
reception of the evening’s recruits, Dolores’ mental pulse
accelerated. She strove for the strong thoughts which lately
had sustained her and tried to keep out of her expression
the pinch of hope long deferred.</p>

<p>“Are these likenesses, sweet Grief?”</p>

<p>Turning, she found Satan at her elbow, offering her half-a-dozen
sepia-like photographs. She took them; looked;
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“John&mdash;<i>wonderful!</i> And this is Catherine at her best.
How splendid of dear Clarke Shayle! Rufus Holt, too.
Have you had them made for me? But why include these
of Vincent Seff and Dr. Willard? I’d rather forget them.”</p>

<p>“Does the murderer forget the features of the slain? Nay,
fair assassin, you won’t need this collection for your dressing
table to remember your victims. These are stills selected
from our stock of life-films. I am glad you pronounce them
such likenesses, for I’m sending them up to old Mors of
the Mystery Gate to hang in his rogues’ gallery.”</p>

<p>“To Mors?”</p>

<p>Satan nodded. “I mean to put a stop-order on the lot, in
case any of them come through ticketed to Elysium. I need
their kind down here.”</p>

<p>“But I thought it was written in the tome called Judgments
of Men where shades should spend the time until the
Call,” she puzzled. “Doesn’t each enter his new estate as he
left the old? Must not his Earth record hold?”</p>

<p>His Highness frowned at the reminder. “Just because
a rule never has been broken is no reason why it never will
be. I may try, mayn’t I? Queer if I can’t frighten Mors
into making a few exceptions.” He turned to the operator.
“Get the old ghoul. I would a word with him.”</p>

<p>The connection soon was made. Ensued a brief exchange,
but one so vehement that the operator cautioned his master
to calm down, lest he blow out all the fuses about the place.</p>

<p>“There is one of them I must have, old-timer,” Satan continued
less offensively. “John Cabot by name and physiognomy.
Likely to come through this very night....
<i>What</i> ... What for, in the name of Hell?... Gallantry
on Earth, eh?... Death, you’re a choicer fool than your
sister Birth!”</p>

<p>As he banged the receiver on its hook, Dolores arose.</p>

<p>“John has gone on&mdash;up into Elysium?” Her voice was
more faint from surprise than his had been strong. “He
won’t&mdash;- come down&mdash;this way?”</p>

<p>At the nod which His Highness spared her from his rage,
she crossed the room, went out the door and down the steps.
She was well along the path when he caught up with and
stopped her.</p>

<p>“A word to the unwise,” said he. “To be without a job
is an embarrassing situation anywhere&mdash;particularly so down
here. Your fancy position as First Royal Entertainer has
come to an end. You’ll do well to take on the next best
thing that offers, lest your ability become discredited. I
really believe you’re the ablest she-devil ever given a chance
to work out her own damnation. You have unique powers,
but there is no personal power that cannot be destroyed.
And I am the Destroyer.”</p>

<p>“This position you offer is so&mdash;is very difficult,” the girl-soul
protested.</p>

<p>“Isn’t everything worth while difficult? And you are very
clever, although in ways that may be used for or against you.
On Earth you failed, just as badly managed talent often fails.
Here I, the Boss Producer of a play called Sin, stand ready
to star you in a success such as you, with your present
limitations, cannot conceive. Already you know something
of me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dolores interrupted, although haltingly. “I know that you
are&mdash;that you, too, are difficult.”</p>

<p>“At least that.” He bowed, as if thanking her. “Since
it confuses you to consider me, pray consider yourself. It is
plain that you’ve been, like myself, wrong since birth. Count
the men you’ve ruined, every one of whom turned to good
works after your influence was removed. Think of what you
did&mdash;the first earth-law for women that you broke. What
you’ve needed is a manager just a shade worse-minded than
yourself. Now you’re offered one and a chance such as no
vampire of Earth or Hell ever aspired to. It is a position
fitted to the applicant, as your employment-agency friend,
<i>née</i> Shinn, would say. What more ambitious rôle could you
find than arousing the worst, not in one, but in all the men
controlled by women in the world?”</p>

<p>She drew her arm from his detaining clutch. “I have,
you know, until&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll wait. But mind you, there’ll be no extension
of time. Yes or no, and Hell help you if it be no!
I want to get you started, so that I can give my own energies
to the incipient race riots in America. Great field for trouble.
All the wealth of the world is there, with the basest traitors
cast out of other countries to misuse it. Go home, since
you must have that last day of disgrace. But be ready with
your answer to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Like well-aimed shot, the syllables riddled Dolores’ brain.
A wounded doe, she hurried on her way to cover.</p>

<p><i>To-morrow.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night while she lay bleeding of her heart wound,
Dolores roused to the perception of an unaccustomed metallic
sound. She realized that, for some time, she had been hearing
it. Tap, tap, <i>tap</i>&mdash;it now increased in peremptoriness.
Someone must be trying to attract her attention from outside
the window.</p>

<p>She sat up among her pillows of satin sheen. By the
sulphuric glow of the night-light, she saw that it was after
one o’clock, three long hours since Adeline had tip-toed out.</p>

<p>After one and <i>to-morrow</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The face of the sardonyx-like clock seemed to grin back
at her in anticipation of the seventh&mdash;said to be the perfect
day. “The faith of fools&mdash;the faith of fools!” it ticked
away.</p>

<p>Until she knew that John was not to join her, she had
failed to appreciate how greatly she was relying upon his
assistance and advice. To choose between His Majesty’s
diabolic assignment and the ingenious torments to which she
and her babe would be subjected became the more impossible
the longer she considered.</p>

<p>Were she what she once had been, expectant of the best
because all-ignorant of the worst, she would have decided,
without a moment’s hesitation, upon what she knew to be
right. But knowledge was weakening. Constant association
with sin and suffering wore away the best intentions. To
struggle against fore-assured failure until the negligent hopes
of Gehenna changed to fear and fear changed, to despair&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She covered her eyes from the suggestive leer of the clock-face
and sank back into the veil of her crepe-black hair.</p>

<p>“Amor ... Innocentia ... Where are you?”</p>

<p>“Tap! <i>Tap!</i>”</p>

<p>As though in answer to her stifled sob of loneliness, the
metallic sound was repeated on the pane. Could they be
without, the comrades of her youth, come to console her
even before she called? Into <i>peignoir</i> and mules she hurried;
crossed the room; threw wide the casement.</p>

<p>“Who is it? Who is there?”</p>

<p>“Sh&mdash;hush!”</p>

<p>In the answering rasp sounded neither the lilt of Innocentia
nor the fearlessness of the love-lad Amor. From out the
deep shadows that hugged the palace wall limped the lately-promoted
General Cummings. More spectral than seemed
consistent with his brief lapse from mortality he looked
as he crossed the sill. From his once tranquil eyes shone
the hell-haunted look of the archaics. His kindly old face
was stretched and blanched.</p>

<p>“What has happened to you, Corporal Sam?” Dolores’
tones sounded her distress at the change in him.</p>

<p>Before replying he drew the window hangings and dimmed
the night lamp. “No one must discover I’m here. They say
His Highness knows everything that goes on in the palace,
but I have risked it. You seem the only chance of saving
us.”</p>

<p>From the edge of the bed, Dolores focused her amazement
upon the doughty soldier-soul. “Saving you&mdash;from
what?”</p>

<p>“From his Great Intention.” Old Sam’s voice shivered
into a whisper. “You don’t understand? I’ve heard that
even the prime minister is not in his confidence. But I
hoped that you had wormed it out of him. Since I understood,
I haven’t rested day nor night, although there’s little
I can do. You have no idea what a hold he’s got on those
fight-fiends. I don’t want to hurt your feelings, miss, that is
to say ma’am, but from the reports of your séances you’ve
turned some mighty powerful mortal minds topsy-turvy.
For your own sake, for the sake of God Himself&mdash;wouldn’t
you be willing to try?”</p>

<p>“To try just what?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m telling you.” Stiff from apprehension,
the old <i>manes’</i> lips formed clumsily to his revelation. “His
Lowness aims to march into the Fields before Judgment,
conquer the Elysiumites and hurl the Great-I-Am from His
throne. Don’t you understand yet? <i>He aims to set himself
on high as God-of-all!</i>”</p>

<p>“Oh, but he can’t do that! How <i>could</i> he conquer God?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t be so sure could you see how those hordes
take to training. Every decent impulse is drilled out of
them. The kind of frightfulness he’s planning makes a lately
mortal brain reel. Ma’am, I calculate that he’s going to
win.”</p>

<p>“No! The Great-I-Am would not let him.”</p>

<p>At the girl-shade’s vehemence the old soul waggled his
head, in his eyes the shadow of horrors that might not be
forgot.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen wrong conquer right on Earth, or you
wouldn’t be here. I’ve lost all hope unless&mdash;From what I
hear I wasn’t so far off about his having a weakness for
you. In camp every officer has his joke about the modern
Delilah that’s destroying the Destroyer. All Gehenna is
talking over his neglect of affairs of state to amuse you
with shows and such. Not once of late has he been to most
of the sham battles that he used to review daily.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you overrate&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, ma’am, but that’s the best. The worst can’t
be overrated. You see, they call him the Hope of Hell.
His hold on the hordes is that, if they drive on to victory
in the great offensive, they win eternal release. They fight
for themselves, not him. If they lose, they’ll be the first
cast into the bottomless pit forever and ever, amen. If
they win, he’ll give them rank and estates in the new autocracy
of universal, everlasting, licensed crime. I don’t fear
for myself so much. I and even you might sink low enough
to get by without exciting suspicion that we’re unsympathetic.
It’s the Elysiumites that are going to suffer. Miss, can’t you
imagine what a Satanic victory would mean to a gentle spirit
like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>To hide his emotion Old Sam covered his face with both
hands.</p>

<p>“My Mary Gertrude never was mistreated in her life.
But I wouldn’t put it past these helliot hordes to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dolores shuddered. “The damned masters and the blessed
their slaves?”</p>

<p>“You begin to understand. Isn’t there someone up there
that you feel grateful to&mdash;someone you’d hate to see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My mother died to give me life,” the spirit-girl breathed.
“And my father must be with her. He’s not down here.
Intemperance, you know, is considered a disease, not a crime,
in the eyes of men. And then there’s little Jack Cabot. He
seemed really to trust every word I told him about his reward
if he did what was right. I couldn’t bear to see poor,
crippled Jack&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>General Sam nodded. “It comes home, doesn’t it, ma’am,
when you think of those you love?”</p>

<p>“<i>Love?</i>” With the word, Dolores threw up her head.
Into the veteran’s pale eyes her dark ones gloomed. “Already
the King hates the one I love. If Satan should come
into this limitless power, what torments he would devise for
the great soul of John Cabot!”</p>

<p>A sound startled them. The soldier-shade hobbled toward
the window by which he had entered, motioning her to follow.
Before opening the shutter, he whispered:</p>

<p>“I’d best go. I dare not come again and there’s no way
I can help you. You’ll have to make up your own mind
what to do. Only remember there isn’t much time. He’s
nigh about ready to strike. God A’mighty give you wisdom,
ma’am.”</p>

<p>He had wrung her hand. Almost was he over the sill
when a blinding flash struck at him from out the drab-dim
night. Not a sound escaped him. Not so much as a clutch
at the air stayed his fall. His right hand raised to his cap
visor in his old-time salute. Then backward he fell upon
the floor.</p>

<p>When Dolores’ eyes had recovered from their momentary
confusion, she saw His Majesty standing just without. His
pleased look reminded her of the fearing wretch she had
saved from a like attack yesterday. Only the hope born of
her happiness had defeated his power to hurt her. Although
not happy now, she was far from despair. Should he turn
next on her, only faith could save her. She must believe
that, despite appearances on Earth and in Shadow Land,
good was stronger than evil.</p>

<p>He stepped aside, the King; glanced at the procumbent
figure; smiled his attractive smile.</p>

<p>“Damme if one can count upon the taste feminine!”</p>

<p>The cynicism he addressed to the double of himself that
showed in the nearest mercurized pier-panel of her chamber.
For a moment he contemplated the dim reflection of his
splendid proportions, the clean-cut features of his infernally
youthful face and the perfection of his evening attire.</p>

<p>“Is no age or fraction of he-man safe from you?” he commented.
“So <i>this</i> is why he always plead your cause, why
I caught him <i>rendezvousing</i> with you in the garden, why
he talked me down? These shallow-looking folk, forsooth,
are the deep ones.”</p>

<p>“Your Lowness&mdash;” Dolores approached him with blaze-indignant
eyes&mdash;“surely you do not assume that I or General
Sam&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I never assume. I know the worst. That’s my power.
I ought to be disgusted with you, and yet&mdash;&mdash;” He considered
her face almost as interestedly as he had his own.
The charm of his smile increased. He added: “I’ve often
noticed that men never get disgusted with the lady in the
case. But I’ll make a horrible example of that broken-winged
old moth, lured here by your light, for benefit of
other mashers. Have to protect your promiscuous stamp of
vamp from the outside.”</p>

<p>That he was angrier than he sounded was suggested by
the snap of his fingers toward the window. Into the chamber
sprang a pair of the palace guards.</p>

<p>“Nerve shock&mdash;<i>boomeranged</i>.” Laconically His Highness
gestured toward the soldier-soul. “Lay him out in the Revival
Room. See you handle him gently until I advise you
what particular form his mistreatment is to take. I must
work out something especially effective.”</p>

<p>He followed to the casement, as the stalwarts carried out
the victim of his inviolate will. There he turned, as though
chancing to remember the recipient of the two nocturnal
calls.</p>

<p>“Miss or madame, I wish you good morrow. As your&mdash;ah&mdash;friend
was saying at the moment of my interruption, remember
that there isn’t much time. Think things over.”</p>

<p>Dolores took the repeated advice. Through the long, vague
hours of the Avernian dawn she did think things over;
thought and thought.</p>

<p>His Highness said she had power. Indeed, she must have
power, else she could not have flouted, even in small ways,
his mastery. But hers was not the power for sin which he
ascribed to her. Long ago a brilliant lawyer had toasted it
as “truth.” Before that she herself had called it “sincerity.”
She knew before trying that she should fail at the task of
rousing the worst in women, when their best had been her
Earth-life ideal.</p>

<p>Since nothing in all the universe was meant to be wasted&mdash;not
a throb of heart or thought of mind&mdash;why had she been
given power? To lose it in the chaos of disappointment into
which she had sunk after realizing that John Cabot was not
to come to her&mdash;that the sentences for the same crime in
man and his woman were not necessarily the same? She
had been anticipating Hell. Although the time before That
Day might be short, she might yet earn progression; perhaps
might go to John, since he had not come to her. Suppose
she had the right with everyman to draw upon the
exhaustless supply of strength which they claimed was God&mdash;&mdash;
Suppose she could possess more and still more of this
power of sincerity&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Stronger than the gleams of the up-rising electric sun
grew her determination; brighter her hope; realer her faith.
The Rex of Reversals did not know everything, else would
he have realized ere this that he could not conquer her.
And he <i>had</i> some sort of weakness for her. Otherwise he’d
have crushed her long ago. In the present emergency she
would seem to yield to him. She would match power against
power, wit against wit, subtlety against subtlety. She would
take the case of the women of the world, but take it, as had
Rufus Holt that of Cabot <i>versus</i> Cabot, to lose. By stress
of her own emotion she had learned that only spiritual
strength was necessary to communicate with Earth. That
discovery should not be wasted. Over the official wireless
through the days would she command evils. In the night-time,
with only her own yearning soul as sending station and
the souls of Earth’s sad women as receivers, would she counter-command.</p>

<p>Perhaps the time would be shorter than General Cummings
feared or His Majesty hoped. Perhaps The Call
would sound before he found her out. And if she was insincere
toward her enemy, it would be that she might be
the more sincere toward her friends. A judge of Earth
had absolved her of guilt at first sight because he saw in
her face that her motive was innocent. Surely the Great
Judge would be as keen.</p>

<p>As for the unspeakable thing known, without being known,
as The Great Intention, that also might she delay and divert.
On Earth she had been called a menace to men. If wiles
enough remained at her command, now that she needed them
to save rather than destroy herself&mdash;if the value of her
favors did not decrease with deliberate use of them&mdash;she
soon would have the soldier messenger set free. With or
without him, however, she would find ways to weaken the
King’s hold upon his military. While Satan was giving
the whole of his intelligence to inciting riot among the mixed
races of her own America she would be sowing schism among
the condemned who had been drafted and branded into the
Hadean armies.</p>

<p>The truth ought to be spreading propaganda. With what
little she could disseminate on Earth and the much she must
begin at once to spread in Gehenna&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Adeline’s tap on her door announced that what couldn’t
happen had happened&mdash;that she had caught up with the
elusive to-morrow. But sufficient unto the seventh day was
the enlightenment thereof.</p>

<p>Dolores was ready at last with her answer.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</h3>
</div>

<p>Soft as the light shed from Beyond, a breeze blew over
the inner fields of Elysium. Soft also was the whispered
gratitude of the olive trees and palms; soft the smiles of
the flowers of lilies and of Lebanon, of celestial roses, of
amorant and of rustling immortelles. The ribbon-like stream
that bounded the emerald velvet skirts of the meadow-land
fluttered from the buoyant breath.</p>

<p>Of the trees, only a spruce atop a nearby knoll failed
to sway. Too heavy was it with birds. Although its branches
down-hung dejectedly, from its tip waved skyward a tuneful
panegyric. So full was the chorus, it seemed that every
songster must be voicing a heart full of joy. Yet one there
was that did not sing, a yellow, strongly visible atom of
immortality perched upon a low-swung twig.</p>

<p>His head was perked to one side. His round, quick eyes
were fixed on the glittering hazes that hung, like veils of
silver-mesh veiling countless finer veils of golden threads,
before the Source of Light. He was looking and listening.
An excited chirp escaped him. With the motions of a bird
unused to the exercise of his wings, he half hopped, half
flew from his branch to the sward and started with what
speed he might across the greening pastures.</p>

<p>One spiritualized to follow the hope of so small a shade
would have seen turning back from a company of spirits,
then advancing into the radiant distances, the form of a
child&mdash;a boy-soul of some nine years. With an odd, slithering
sort of walk, he retraced his steps. Now and then he
would stop and, shading his eyes, would peer in the general
direction of the Mystery Gate. He, too, appeared to be listening
and looking.</p>

<p>Although Jack Cabot still limped, he had out-progressed
any pain of consciousness over his deformity. Knowing
that except for the imperfect union of his parents, he would
have been born perfect in love, he believed that the visible
of him would be straightened at his second birth. Adjudged
an innocent offspring of righteousness, he had been unhampered
by the curse of the world; indeed, had been given
benefit of every doubt. His movements had gained freedom
and his features had beautified. On closer view, however,
his expression showed to be disconsolate. His sigh was repeated
in that of another back-gazing <i>manes</i> whom he passed.</p>

<p>“Don’t you belong to anybody, too?” Jack asked him.
“Mors told me I was assigned to bliss. I walk so much
easier now, I know I ought to go on. But, oh, I am so
lonely!”</p>

<p>“I know. I know”&mdash;the stranger-shade. “It is hard to
be blissful alone.”</p>

<p>At the moment Jack espied the tiny yellow creature fluttering
toward him. An eager chirp started him toward it, at
first hesitantly, then as fast as he could go. Thus met the
two passionate spirits which had been caged together on
Earth&mdash;the one passionate in his resentment, the other in the
determination, instinct, or whatsoever may be called the will
of a bird, to teach the joy of life.</p>

<p>In his hurry, Jack stumbled and fell, both hands outstretched.
Into them flew the yellow mite; twittered ecstatically;
billed the boyish lips that quivered into sobs and
laughter.</p>

<p>“You look like&mdash;You <i>are</i>! Oh, Dick, you flew into the
Light after me? You have been hunting for me? I’m
ashamed of the way I used to treat you, Dickie bird. But
you understand now, don’t you, that it was only because I
didn’t ’preciate that there’s a heart in every living thing,
sometimes the biggest in the littlest? I had my eyes so set
on a dog that I didn’t see how precious you were! I wonder
did the gold-fish like me, too? It means something when a
boy’s bird will die to follow him. I’m ashamed, Dick.
Honest, I’m awful ashamed.”</p>

<p>The canary’s response was a burst of the song which he
had not sung when sitting upon the spruce tree, bereft of
companionship although in the company of so many of his
kind. Perched upon the boy-shade’s shoulder, he revealed his
secret in sound. Higher and freer and more poignantly sweet
than ever fluted songster of Earth, he gave out on the
Elysian air the theme of selfless love.</p>

<p>Inspirited, Jack continued on his return over the fields.
He walked evenly that he might not dislodge his pet. And
he chatted appreciatively in the intervals of the song, to
atone for his unappreciative past.</p>

<p>“There are all sorts of musicians as you go nearer the
Light, they tell me. There are pipers and harpers and
trumpeters and countless choir-singers that almost make you
long to die again for joy. But I’ll bet there’s none will sing
so sweet as you, Dick. Once I’m satisfied to go on, I’ll take
you with me and give you the chance you never had on
Earth.”</p>

<p>By now the two were well over the crest of the stream-skirted
knoll. Toward them, from the direction of the gate,
spirits fluttered like leaves in a wind. Voices called out
through the spaces&mdash;glad cries of greeting and wails of disappointment
worn weak from repetition.</p>

<p>As before, Jack shielded his eyes with one hand and peered
about. And, as he peered, he vented a cry that was the
aggregate of all certitude. His left hand he lifted to guard
the bird, then started down the hill.</p>

<p>From out the nether hazes a man-shade came climbing
toward them. That he lately had arrived from Earth showed
in the anxiety of his dark, strong face. When he saw who
was shuffling toward him and recognized the excited, childish
voice hailing him, he increased his pace. When they
met, father and son:</p>

<p>“Greetings, John Cabot!”</p>

<p>“Jack Cabot, greetings!”</p>

<p>The large and small hands gripped.</p>

<p>“I had a feeling you were due,” explained the boy, conquering
the first incoherency of his delight. “I guess Dick
must have felt the same way. Did you hear him sing as we
came over the hill? Oh, John, I’m so glad you’ve come!
This is a wonderful place to be happy in. But you can’t
be happy alone. I’ve come back ever so often, hoping that
you or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t seen her yet?”</p>

<p>“You mean?” For a moment the child-soul stared up at
his father’s emotionful face. He stood on tip-toe to whisper
his interpretation, lest the joy-jealous zephyrs snatch it away.
“Not her&mdash;not <i>’Lores</i>!”</p>

<p>“She came a month since. I am sure she would have
been on the lookout for you, Jack. Strange you have not
met.”</p>

<p>“Maybe&mdash;&mdash;” Jack shuddered. “It’s an awful journey
over. Maybe she got so afraid of the snakes and the owls
and the wild asses&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There’s no stopping along the highway, son. Every soul
survives the dread of death, they tell me. In reality, the
transition between the two phases of existence is brief. At
the gate they told me that she had passed through, but they
refused so much as a hint at the direction she had taken. I’ve
covered the border fields thoroughly since I came. Had
concluded she must have found you and gone on.”</p>

<p>His concern lowered like a shadow to Jack’s face. “It
don’t seem like ’Lores to forget me. I’d never give up trying
to find her.”</p>

<p>“She may not have known that I was on the way.” John
appeared to be advising himself. “But she did seem so close
to me that morning above the sea. Her voice sounded so
clear&mdash;so near. I was sure she had called me. If I could
hear her with ears of clay, it seems as though she&mdash;&mdash; I
tried to answer her. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Neither father nor son had noticed two small clouds which
had appeared on the horizon line above the nether world.
Mere fluttering specks at first, they had developed color and
form in a rapid approach. They settled upon the sward and
hurried forward. He in advance was of up-standing form,
his face beautiful and ardent, despite its lines of care. By
one hand, he led a fair girl spirit whose head hung as if
from shame and whose eyes, on close approach, showed to
brim with tears. Boldly enough the youth lined up before
the two Cabots.</p>

<p>“I am Amor and this is Innocentia. You know us well,
although on Earth you could not see us. In a way we belong
to you as well as to our dear Dolores.”</p>

<p>“Dolores?” John snatched at the name. “You can tell
us where she is?”</p>

<p>“Let me prepare you”&mdash;in pity, Amor. “I owe my life
to you, John Cabot. I was, in fact, born of your heart beats
that day you first saw her in Seff’s shop. Not consciously&mdash;of
course mortals realize only the half of what they do&mdash;you
sent me to her side to guide her. I have done what I could.
But earthlings have no care for love. They never think to
spare it until after it is dead.”</p>

<p>The shy girl spirit was moved by her comrade’s self-depreciation
to speak. “Amor has been splendid. He was close
beside her when she heard the news that you had been sent
to the Fields. He proposed our search for you. And he
held me up with sheer strength when I felt that I must
swoon from exhaustion. Always he has tried to protect
me even as&mdash;as you.”</p>

<p>“As I?” John asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t you recognize me yet?” She brushed the moisture
from her eyes and lifted them to his, twin blue anemones.
“I am what you loved best in your love. Although you could
not see me as now, you knew that I was there. You held
me dearer than her beauty, than her youth&mdash;yes, even than
her passion for you.”</p>

<p>“In mercy’s name, don’t taunt me!” John’s voice was a
sort of groan. “I did value you. I tried to save you from
myself. God knows how hard I tried. It seems incredible
to me now that I should have torn you from her&mdash;trampled
on you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Trampled me? You never did that.” Her timidity conquered
by sight of his suffering, Innocentia touched his arm.
“Not for one minute was I really afraid of you. A great
love, such as yours, could not harm me. Amor often told
me that. I stayed close to her on Earth and crossed with
her into Shadow Land.”</p>

<p>“Even down there we’ve been with her most of the time,”
Amor added.</p>

<p>“<i>Down there?</i>” Startled out of his shame, John Cabot
peered into the care-worn faces of the guardian pair. “You
mean&mdash;she is assigned&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He read the answer in their distressed, averted looks. His
mind was quickly made.</p>

<p>“Lead on&mdash;and down!”</p>

<p>“But, John&mdash;&mdash;” Young Jack clung tight to one of the
knotted fists that hung at his father’s side&mdash;“you can’t go
into Gehenna. You and I are assigned to the Fields. It
is a rule here that we can go on, but never back.”</p>

<p>“Go on&mdash;without her?” John laughed in a short, hard
way. “There is no right in a rule that assigns me to Elysium
and her to Gehenna. I’ll find a way to prove that one man
feels responsible for a woman’s fall. Son, I am going to
bring her back with me.”</p>

<p>“If you could, John&mdash;if only you could!” Afraid, yet
brave to believe in the power of his god of Earth, the boy-soul
gazed into his father’s face. “You’ll look for me,
John, first thing when you come back? A little way on there
are bowers and villas that the shades build to live in while
their eyes and minds are getting used to the Light. They
leave them empty for anyone to take when they’re ready to
progress nearer the Source. You’ll know the one I’m in
if you listen to hear Dick sing. I’ll be waiting for you and&mdash;and
<i>her</i>, John Cabot.”</p>

<p>“Jack Cabot, until we meet again!”</p>

<p>In time the boy had remembered his lameness, so did not
plead to go along. The best way to expedite his hero’s return
was to let him proceed unencumbered. Striving for
courage, he watched the tall form follow Amor and Innocentia
across the fields. A twitter reminded him that he was
not entirely deprived. Gulping back his disappointment, he
declared manfully:</p>

<p>“We’ll get a nice place ready for her, Dick&mdash;my other
mother. He says he’ll bring her back, so we know he will.
John can do anything. It <i>will</i> be fun being happy!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Across the mystery wastes that lie between the mortal
world and Shadow Land looms a redoubtable wall. Through
its gateway any from Earth may pass at will. But none may
return.</p>

<p>Just within, the two head ushers slumped upon their bench
and gazed over the familiar, but incogitable scene. The well-worn
inward path soon divided, its lower half to drop over a
declivity, whence it sloped “easily” into Avernus, its upper
to wind away and away until lost in that incalculably distant
glow.</p>

<p>“Queer set this”&mdash;the first usher.</p>

<p>“Queer is right&mdash;or wrong”&mdash;his fellow. “I’d like to
know, for instance, what makes that Light.”</p>

<p>“I, too. Can’t be either sun or moon, because it never
sets.”</p>

<p>The chief’s eyes fixed on a verdant slope, from whose
hazes a female figure sped with apprehensive manner toward
the base of the wall. He shrugged on seeing a unit of the
boundary patrol return her into the Fields, but gently, with
never a threat of spear.</p>

<p>“One of the yearning mothers, I suppose. Strange how
they’re possessed to slip back to their children!”</p>

<p>“Children who likely aren’t wasting a worry on them,”
the associate sighed. “Why won’t mothers let bad enough
alone?”</p>

<p>A wail like the lament of a lost zephyr drew their attention
to the rim.</p>

<p>“That fool woman in love trying to descend again,” the
second usher continued to grumble. “She’s not the first
who’s insisted that she’d rather be in Hell with him than in
Heaven without. Quaint, isn’t it, considering that we don’t
have any trouble with men in vice-versa cases?”</p>

<p>“Hi, guardsmen! You asleep? What’s wrong over
there?”</p>

<p>With his cry, the chief sprang up and hurried toward the
down path. Ahead of him ran the spear-carrier whom he
had called to task. Behind came his fellow.</p>

<p>From the brume of the upper distances a group of three
spirits had emerged and were rushing downward, regardless
of the shade patrol. Through the array of spears leveled
against them they darted as though impervious to wounds
of fear.</p>

<p>On the rock-strewn cliff the reinforcements found themselves
facing an aroused man-<i>manes</i> whose like they never
had seen. Clothed in an armor of light was John Cabot,
“his eyes as lamps of fire ... and the voice of his words
like the voice of a multitude.”</p>

<p>“What matter the judgments of men, after man’s little
day is done? Make way. I am going through.”</p>

<p>“Drive him back,” commanded the chief usher. “All together
now!”</p>

<p>Against the row of leveled spear points, John hurled
himself.</p>

<p>“Right is might and I am right,” he cried.</p>

<p>“You can’t pit one will against hundreds and win,” the
chief contended. “Stop a second. Realize how foolish&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And what is folly but a riotous expenditure of will?”
At his application of the memory flash, John laughed. “This
is&mdash;to will&mdash;and to have&mdash;my will,” he panted as he fought
the united determination to stay him. “You witness the end&mdash;of
my social ideas&mdash;my immoderate desires&mdash;my excesses&mdash;my
pleasures that&mdash;have ended&mdash;in death. A laugh for&mdash;your
hundreds&mdash;of wills!”</p>

<p>Perhaps by his rashness, perhaps by force of the wind now
rousing in strength from over the Fields, the light forms of
Amor and Innocentia were snatched up and borne through
the ranks of the guard. At sight of their disappearance into
the abyss, John’s eyes blazed like lit torches.</p>

<p>“Since mind is more than matter up here&mdash;since this is a
world of will&mdash;let the stronger will prevail!”</p>

<p>From the grasp of the nearest of the patrol, he wrenched
a torch-lit spear. Waving it on high, he rushed their resistance;
engaged them; smote their thoughts with his
thoughts. The two ushers fell back, powerless to contend
against him.</p>

<p>“He must be a madman,” gasped the chief.</p>

<p>“Or a god”&mdash;his associate.</p>

<p>Both shook in the greatening gale. Both paled to see that
the mystery Light, which had abided since their entrance into
Shadow Land, was being eclipsed by Stygian clouds. So
dark grew the air that they scarcely could discern the form
of the man-<i>manes</i> outlined against the rim. But his battle-cry
came back to them.</p>

<p>“<i>Make way&mdash;make way for my mind!</i>”</p>

<p>Into the thunders that rocked the clouds merged his voice.
Lightnings lit his victory. Madman or god, he plunged over
the rim.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</h3>
</div>

<p>Early as she dared that forenoon, Dolores had sought
audience with the King. From calculation new to her, she
had arrayed herself to please him. Ceding the mauves and
dove grays that seemed best to express her, she had selected
one of the court creations designed for her by the master
electrician of His Highness’s own robes&mdash;an effect as of
dawn-tinted tulles weighted by a tunic sewn over with rose
rubies. Her hair she had wrapped about her head like a
splendid coronet. To the handle of the jasper-like staff to
be carried with the costume she had fastened the tiny dynamo
of a full-blown, scarlet rose and in the ribbon of one silver
sandal, just over the high-arched instep, had tied a closed,
pearl-dewed bud. Upon Adeline’s verdict of “Exquisite,
madame!” she had studied the mercury lest any possibility
of further effect be neglected. The reflection was of a
woman-soul, young, fresh, hopeful as the early morn, yet
already aglow from the red realizations of her noon-day.</p>

<p>His Majesty received her alone in the throne-room.
Among fulsome compliments he interspersed his gratification
that she had not awaited a summons from him.</p>

<p>Dolores was more surprised by this affability than she
should have been by any new truculence. For the first moments
she found herself overcome by what she had prepared
to overcome in him&mdash;indignation.</p>

<p>“Then you did not really suspect me last night?”</p>

<p>He lifted a protesting hand. “You wouldn’t deprive me
of that pleasure? Can’t you conceive how much rivals are
enjoyed by the admirer who need have no fear?” He descended
the dais to substantiate the claim in the mirror.</p>

<p>After he had placed the prime minister’s chair for her,
she gave him her answer. She would accept the office of
Low Priestess.</p>

<p>At the quiet pronouncement a gleam lit the steel of his
eyes.</p>

<p>“I am glad,” said he. “Sooner or later&mdash;probably sooner
<i>than</i> later&mdash;I should have made you accept it. However, it
is gratifying that you have done so, shall we say, <i>near</i>-voluntarily?
You make me hope that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He bent his head and looked into her face. Soon he
finished in the smooth voice of a hierophant expounding his
doctrine.</p>

<p>“You make me hope several things of you. From your
viewpoint I ought to despise you for last night’s discovery
that your vamping mania has consumed a soldier from my
ranks doddering enough to be your grandfather.”</p>

<p>“You are too intelligent to believe that,” she flashed.</p>

<p>“Nice work for an earthly audience. But it’s not to your
interest to convince me. I am too delighted to find you worse
than you at times appear. Did you notice down in the world
that the virtuous women keep the devotion of their men?
I guess not. One difference between me and male earthlings
is that I own up to a depravity which they are taught from
birth to deny. The worse I think you, the longer you’re
likely to hold me. Pray let me dream on!”</p>

<p>“To hold&mdash;<i>you?</i>”</p>

<p>Something of sincerity in his voice forced the query.
Instantly she regretted it.</p>

<p>“That <i>naïveté</i> is your cleverest trick,” he approved. “You
probably guessed long before I did my&mdash;ah&mdash;dishonorable
intentions. Since you ask, I don’t mind declaring them here
and now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not now&mdash;not here!”</p>

<p>With the protest she got to her feet and turned toward
the door. But she was stopped by the compelling look of
him.</p>

<p>“Why should I be willing to invest you with a power equal
almost to my own? Am I likely to overlook how much more
deadly is the female than the male&mdash;how much faster you
will grow in sin than I have done, once you are well started?
Should I risk your attempting to overthrow me by not making
our interests one?”</p>

<p>She did not answer his questions. And she asked none
other. She stood, perforce, waiting to hear that of which
instinct had warned her all along.</p>

<p>He began again in different vein. “I’ve been mighty lonely
down here these last few thousand years. You see, I’ve
never been appreciated or understood. The moment I saw
you that terrible Tuesday&mdash;or was it a tragic Thursday?&mdash;I
appreciated that you were different. To have the sympathy
and approval of a woman-soul like you&mdash;&mdash;” He interrupted
with a laugh at himself. “But there, I’ll leave that ‘lonely,’
‘misunderstood’ old plea for the husbands of the world to
tell other men’s wives. The truth is, you have convinced me
that I’ve missed a whole lot. Much as I despise weaknesses,
I have come to feel that one would be a luxury. Dolores,
I want to love you.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want you to.” She stepped back from him.</p>

<p>“And I want you,” he continued imperturbably, “to want
to love me. I could have made you do so long ago, just as
your hypnotic osteopath could have done, but I’d not be satisfied
with that brand. Come, give the devil his due!”</p>

<p>All she gave him was silence. He watched her while continuing.</p>

<p>“In the close relationship which I propose, you’ll have
greater opportunity to quip my curiosity and compel my admiration.
Should I tire of you our community of interests
will bind me to you much as earthlings are bound in that
state called&mdash;Fairest fiend, I ask you to become my queen.”</p>

<p>“<i>No!</i>”</p>

<p>Dolores was dismayed beyond all discretion. She tried
to throw off the clutch which he laid upon her arm.</p>

<p>“You’d be wiser to conceal your aversion,” he advised.
“You are going to accept me whether you wish to or not, just
as you have accepted the office of Low Priestess. In both
cases the answer was settled before the proposition was put.
And it is a fair proposition, this last. I am positively anxious
to care for you as much as I can&mdash;more, if anything, than
I intend to make you care for me. ‘He that leadeth into
captivity shall go into captivity.’ Don’t you see? I have
acknowledged my wish for one weakness to give you every
chance for graceful consent. With me it is now or never.
I feel that you are the one woman-shade who can teach me&mdash;well,
what I wish to know. But you won’t get a second
chance. The Great-I-Am is a softy to give man a second
chance in the Redemption. I shall not be that soft regarding
you.”</p>

<p>As still she spoke no word, he urged more stressfully:</p>

<p>“Have you no ambition that you scorn the queenship of
the Universe? That’s what my offer means. I have taken
none into the secret of my Great Intention. And until I
feel that we are one in spirit as in state, I shall not fully
confide in you. But I’ll say that the day of my deliverance
is close at hand. Soon my supremacy shall be established
from everlasting to everlasting. Ruthlessness shall rule before
the time of the end. How long, do you suppose, can
He stand who is self-acknowledged to be all this weakness
called love, against The Hate, which am I?”</p>

<p>The question he blazed into her eyes, now uplifted to the
demand of his.</p>

<p>“Little fool, how dare you hesitate? Consider what you
are and who I am&mdash;your smallness and my greatness. Consider
Eternity. Hell is my home-land. I have conquered
Earth. High Heaven only is to gain. The time is near
when the Castling from Paradise shall return unto his own.
Judgment shall be damned on that day. And I shall be
Jehovah. The Day&mdash;<i>The Day</i>!”</p>

<p>In an ecstasy of egoism, he caught the spirit-girl by the
shoulders; willed her up the steps and into his great carved
chair.</p>

<p>“Sit you in the seat of the mighty,” he ordered. “Learn
the sensation of gracing a throne. Queen of three worlds&mdash;<i>my</i>
queen&mdash;accept the salute of your most abject slave!”</p>

<p>Sinking to one knee he lowered his lips to her bare ankle.
The spot they pressed stung as though from nettles, then
turned redder than the rose-bud tied against her instep.</p>

<p>“I am a suppliant, Queen Dolores&mdash;I who never was a
suppliant before.” His lips increased in ardor through the
contact. “I need you. I want you. But I want you to
acknowledge the need of me. Always have I jeered at mortal
men who plead for favor. I don’t know what’s come over
me. I could take you and make you and break you all in one
flash of my will. And yet&mdash;I ask you, Dolores. I <i>ask</i> you.”</p>

<p>The spirit-girl realized that the time had come for her to
speak, but she could not force her tongue. Gone was her
self-reliance of the early dawn. She had come prepared,
but not for this. Overwhelmed she felt by his declaration
as she had not been by his threats.</p>

<p>The sensation was familiar; recalled those days of uncertainty
in the Cabot home when she had been tried by the
evasive ways of John. Then her fear had been for him and,
through him, for herself. Now he and she were included
only as infinitesimal atoms in the universal disaster that
impended.</p>

<p>Look high as Heaven, look low as Hell, she was afraid.</p>

<p>“How dark it is growing!” She shuddered.</p>

<p>“Is it so dark you cannot see that I am on my knees, still
asking you?”</p>

<p>“How can you ask me, when you know where my heart
belongs?”</p>

<p>His lips lifted over his fang-like teeth, in sudden reversion
to type. “No heart that I want can belong anywhere else,”
he snarled. “You have seen that mongrel lover of yours turn
yellow with cowardice.”</p>

<p>“I have seen him,” she corrected, “conquer cowardice.”</p>

<p>“We won’t quibble. The obstinacy of the female heart is
more often a fault than a virtue. Open your mind to conviction.
Can you imagine me feeling cowardice? I’ve tried
to give you an idea of how bad I am. At least I have shown
enough inherent evil to awaken some slight admiration.”</p>

<p>“But our standards are very different, Your Lowness. I
don’t admire this ruthlessness you boast. The sensations
from love and hate are very much alike, they say. Isn’t
it possible that you are mistaken in the absolutism of your
wickedness? Don’t you suppose that you are capable of a
pulse-beat of mercy for one who&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The flash of lightning that shivered through the thickening
gloom of the great room seemed to illuminate her
broken query with significance. The answering rumble of
thunder was no less menacing than his reply.</p>

<p>“This is heresy. You weaken your capacity for sin with
every such thought. Good as you are, I’ll make you in time
bad as I am. As the queen-consort you shall become the
wickedest thought of my mind, the most vicious desire of
my soul. Deadlier than death, you shall give and keep giving
life to my love. Undying love&mdash;that would be a delicate
morsel, would it not, little gourmet of the hearts of men?”</p>

<p>“All real love is undying,” she maintained.</p>

<p>Her eyes held on the distant curtain. Its alternating electric
stripes were writhing like snakes, as if tormented by a
wind stronger than its dynamo.</p>

<p>“At least, passion is not. Undying passion&mdash;that would
be something new even to you, eh? Do you remember,
siren, my mention of an ‘experiment’?”</p>

<p>Dolores, at the look that was lapping her face, shrank back
into the throne chair. At the burn of his hands as they
pressed her outline from waist to shoulders, a scream broke
from control. But even as she was impelled forward and
down, her terror became exorcised by the lure in the look of
him. That most destructive of all forces&mdash;the brute force
of evil thought&mdash;bent her knees; loosened her clutch of the
chair-arms; drew downward her face. Almost had her lips
met his in a loathing, yet longing soul-caress&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The semi-gloom was lit by many kilowatts of light. The
curtain was torn apart. From the entrance door a tall man-spirit
fought his way. A cursing demon pack surrounded
him. To his legs clung the dwarfs of the Gehennan gate.
Lightnings from the storm without followed him, as steel
slivers follow a magnet. Disheveled, wild of eye from the
fury of his fight, unannounced and undeterred, he forced his
way to the dais steps.</p>

<p>“At last&mdash;<i>John</i>!”</p>

<p>Sad from the very intensity of her gladness rang the bell
tones of Dolores’ salutation. At sight of her beloved she
had found herself; had broken the evil spell put upon her;
had risen from the throne. She stood with hands outstretched,
a visualization of that composite called a woman’s
heart. Ethereal as the fabric of her gown shone her face
and forehead. Rose red as the mesh of rubies that girdled
her glowed her lips. And from the deep purple of her eyes
all mystery cleared&mdash;a royal revelation.</p>

<p>But John Cabot did not accept the invitation of her hands.
He did not ascend the steps. In silence he returned her gaze.
In his ears still rang the scream which had brought him
strength to worst the hellion guards. His mind hurt from
the sobs of the love-lad and Innocentia, huddled in horror
outside the door. His eyes saw only the picture hung before
his entry of a lady downbent and a kneeling knight, their
lips about to meet.</p>

<p>He lifted his regard to the magnificent figure looming
negligently behind the throne-chair. Gray eyes met black, a
soundless clash of iron and steel.</p>

<p>Satan snapped the pause. “So&mdash;you have joined us, after
all?”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said John, “you have the advantage over me.”</p>

<p>“I have, indeed, as will develop on acquaintance. I believe
you have already met her known as Grief to Men.
Suppose you bow before the queen to be.”</p>

<p>John’s gaze returned to the prayer for forgiveness on
Dolores’ face. His leonine head leaned as if to hear the
quiver of her lips. The great soul of him saw more than his
eyes had seen. He granted the prayer, took the offered hand;
bent before the spirit of the woman he had loved until his
kiss swept her finger-tips.</p>

<p>“Dolores, I have come to you. On Earth I was too weak
in flesh to show the strength of my regard for you. But you
should not have distrusted and deserted me. Didn’t you
realize, from your own desolation, how hard it was for me
to stay away?”</p>

<p>“Afterward I realized,” she murmured. “Too late I
knew.”</p>

<p>“I was fighting your enemies, myself chief among them.
I had determined to save your good name. It was ironical
that the friend who tried to help me ruined both your life
and mine. Had I known about the child, even though I
could not have freed myself by law, I should have declared
you my wife before the world&mdash;not as I’d have wished,
but in a binding pact. Dolores, I have come to tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So we observe,” slashed His Majesty’s sword-sharp
voice. “And might I inquire just why you presume to come
to this lady&mdash;you who have a perfectly bad wife on Earth?”</p>

<p>“I am divorced by death.”</p>

<p>John continued to look only at her whose good-faith was
the <i>sine qua non</i> of his desire. She, he could see, was eager
to hear him, despite her apparent fear of the Machiavellian
presence. To her he spoke, low and rapidly.</p>

<p>“I found myself in a burning plane at sea. I seemed to
hear your voice calling me from far away. But the shortcut
I tried to take to you has proved the longest way. When
I learned that you had been assigned to Gehenna and I
by special license to the Fields, I went mad with rage.
That you should be damned and I rewarded for the selfsame
crime was unspeakable! They could not drive me back.
To be spiritually chained to earth would be bad enough, yet
that would have a mortal limit. Even Mors does not seem
to know the date of the Second Call. A century on Earth is
accounted only an hour here. To wait around in futile
transitions from fear to hope&mdash;from hope to fear&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you go on when you had a chance”&mdash;again
Satan interposed&mdash;“on toward that nice place called Paradise?”</p>

<p>“Dolores, you are my Paradise&mdash;lost and regained, though
not yet redeemed. I have come to redeem you.”</p>

<p>“<i>Christ!</i>” Malice sounded close behind the Satanic sneer.
“Just what is your claim, redeemer?”</p>

<p>At last John Cabot answered him directly. “I want justice
for this woman-soul. I want it <i>now</i>. I demand that
you release her.”</p>

<p>“You <i>want</i>? <i>You</i> demand? And you contend that she
belongs to the Fields, she compared with whom the ‘mother
of harlots’ was a saint in a niche?”</p>

<p>“You lie!”</p>

<p>At the suppressed fury of John’s declaration, noxious
fumes began to spread from the Belial glare.</p>

<p>“A strong word to use over a mere disparity in point of
view. However, your compliment sounded genuine and I
thank you. Sorry that your demand must be denied. Law
of the land, you know.”</p>

<p>“The best thing about most laws is that they can be
broken,” John asserted. “I cannot conceive of a great intellect
that would not except this case, once it was explained.
A woman who never had an unclean thought or an impulse
that was not wholly kind has been sent into Badlands, while
each of those who contributed to her fall has been reinstated
in the opinion of men. A shop vulture has made a virtue
of his vulturing. An alleged man of God&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t go through the list,” His Majesty objected. “I’ve
had many a laugh over the choice assortment. Doctor, lawyer,
merchant, chief, richman, poorman, beggar-man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thief?” John interrupted in his turn. “I am the thief.
And even I, the most culpable of all, have ‘come back’ in
the opinion of my fellows&mdash;have been rewarded as was everybody
concerned in her ruin.”</p>

<p>“Yes, even down to that delightful old woman who was so
anxious to get her gas bill paid.”</p>

<p>At the King’s interjection, Dolores sank back into the
throne-chair. Against its high back he leaned for support in
his loudening laughter.</p>

<p>John Cabot did not laugh. With each peal of Satan’s
mirth, his frown darkened.</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of you and your ridicule. If the double-standard
rule is the law to which you refer&mdash;if that holds
beyond the jurisdiction of Earth&mdash;then doubly do I intend
to break it.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> intend? Really, you are&mdash;too funny&mdash;funnier than
all&mdash;the rest!” His Majesty struggled for control of his
risibilities. “Allow me to say that your visit, although something
of a surprise to one who does not often have ’em,
is not unwelcome. It is, in fact, almost too gratifying to be
true. You’re a bold, if not bad man. I have need of your
sort. Of course, you’ll have to be born again. All good
men must be regenerated down here.”</p>

<p>“You don’t intend, then&mdash;” Dolores half turned&mdash;“that
he shall go back?”</p>

<p>“My poor child, do you expect me to flout the gift of
Providence&mdash;even one sent down like this, C. O. D.? He
has about as much chance of going back, this snuffed flame
of yours, as you yourself.”</p>

<p>Stiffening from his negligent pose, he seated himself upon
one arm of the throne-chair and leaned over her confidentially.</p>

<p>“Mayhap you and I would have been even more companionable
had you appreciated how much I, too, have longed
for the coming of John Cabot. Perhaps it is foolish of me,
but I find I’m just a bit jealous of your quondam lovers. I’d
like to have them all down here as sort of safety valves when
I get bad and mad. Having only John, I’d be less than inhuman
to give up taking it out on him. Besides that great
experiment on myself, there’s a lesser one I wish to try out
on you. Now, now, sweet Grief, don’t worry! Nothing
painful. Rather one whose success will bring you delight.”</p>

<p>“Please to&mdash;tell me&mdash;what you mean?” faltered Dolores.</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed that when the only man a woman earthling
ever really loved demises&mdash;shuffles quite beyond her reach,
you know&mdash;she proceeds to love, as soon as she can locate
him, the second only ever man. I’d like to demonstrate that
the rule holds down here. You wouldn’t be true to type if
you didn’t have a lingering sort of affection for every one of
your ex-onlies.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I make John die a second death before your eyes, in
order that he be regenerated unto sin. I crunch to dust the
bones of his spirit. I tear to bits the sinews of his soul.
When you see him an unrecognizable heap in the morgue of
Gehenna, will you like me, do you suppose now, more or
less?”</p>

<p>At her failure to reply, he sauntered toward the nearest
mirror; there carefully adjusted his red cravat. Evidently
reassured by the magnificence of his reflection, he added
amiably enough:</p>

<p>“That Judge Strang was no more a sport than am I. He
took a long chance on you after one short look. After the
some few looks I’ve had, I’ll take a longer one. What say
you, fair fiend? Be a sport, too. Come, let’s make it a bet!”</p>

<p>Her response was a worded moan. “Why, John&mdash;<i>why</i>
did you come?”</p>

<p>For a moment His Majesty considered the drooping, dusk-crowned
head.</p>

<p>“Evidently,” he made remark to whom it might concern,
“she doesn’t consider mine a betting proposition.”</p>

<p>As if suddenly aware of the hellion guard cluttering the
great room, he amused himself driving them back against
the highly-charged curtains.</p>

<p>John Cabot mounted the dais steps; removed the girl-soul’s
hands from her face; held them while he bent to look into
her eyes.</p>

<p>“You are my mate,” he said. “You have been tried&mdash;tempted,
perhaps. But I believe in you. You swore once
to believe in me. Do you remember? Come with me,
Dolores. Let me fight your way up to the Fields as I fought
mine down. Have courage to come.”</p>

<p>“I’d only hold you back,” she sighed.</p>

<p>“The harder the fight, the dearer the victory,” he urged.
“And we should be together. Does that mean nothing to
you? Whatever your fate, I should feel honored to share
it&mdash;to serve you through Eternity in atonement. Where faith
lives there is love.”</p>

<p>“Faith?” A rasping sob shook her&mdash;or was it a laugh?
“Faith, he says, is the fear of fools.”</p>

<p>“Faith is fear? I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Fools pretend faith because they fear. But nobody
really believes in anything down here. Everybody fears&mdash;fears
despair. He’ll never let me go. You must leave me if
you can. Lean low and listen. Later you’ll understand.”</p>

<p>She caught his arm; shook like a reed with her whisper.</p>

<p>“God sacrificed his only begotten Son, they say, to try to
save the world. You must sacrifice your hope of me to try
to save&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Damn you!</i>”</p>

<p>The curse was addressed to the king&mdash;the first Dolores
ever had heard from the lips of John Cabot. Satan had approached
soundlessly; with his charged forefinger and thumb
had flicked the intruder on the brow.</p>

<p>“Save your vitriol. I’m already damned,” he answered
with consummate insolence.</p>

<p>John, blinking confusedly, straightened. The impulses of
his late life still controlled him. With the flash of a puma’s
instinct, he leaped upon the First of Fiends.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>
</div>

<p>Wrath had burned the bonds of John Cabot’s hard-learned
constraint. A fury of resentment over the subjection
of Dolores controlled him. Supernatural might to avenge
and save her seemed to come to him. Yet sudden as was his
leap, strong its impetus, that which was material of his
adversary had side-stepped neatly as though he were some
mortal boxer in a squared circle.</p>

<p>“Positively, you annoy me,” commented Satan from the
far end of the dais.</p>

<p>“You demon dog, your spite is nothing to my righteous
rage!”</p>

<p>Again John rushed the blasphemer with head lowered between
his shoulders; seized and attempted to bear him down.
But face forward he collapsed upon the steps. His will to
kill was conquered by its own futility. Nothing&mdash;quite
nothing was in his grasp. A chuckle caused his glance to
lift. Nearby stood the Tormentor as though untouched. An
opaque aura surrounded him. Thick fumes spread with his
breath.</p>

<p>Cabot staggered to his feet. All too soon the realization
which Dolores had implored was being taught him. What
matter how righteous the cause&mdash;how violent his will for
avengement? This was Too-Late Land.</p>

<p>Satan clapped his hands; commanded the guard.</p>

<p>“Seize the fool. Throw him into the Den of the Demented.
Get him into shape for particular torment. Out
with him!”</p>

<p>“<i>Wait.</i>”</p>

<p>At Dolores’ word the guardsmen halted their rush.
John fixed his eyes upon the regal figure rising from the
throne.</p>

<p>With her rose-adorned staff, upraised like the scepter of
the queen she had been declared, the girl-shade commanded
silence. From her eyes, as from beacon candles behind dark
panes, shone the light of determination. The time had come
for her to test that early-morn resolve of matching her
guile against that of His Satanic Majesty. The look she
leveled upon him was too subtle for even his super-sense to
define.</p>

<p>“Has Your Lowness duly considered?” she asked him.
“You say you never waste power. This shade has proved
at least initiative.”</p>

<p>“A powerful impudence, I call it, to break into our unhappy
little home in this&mdash;ah&mdash;vehement manner and invite
my intended, right before my eyes, to elope with him. He
deserves the worst billet of the Hadean hordes.”</p>

<p>“Granted, sire. But if you draft him, isn’t he likely to
distinguish himself among your conquering heroes? Is there
not a warning in his show of fight?”</p>

<p>“Why a warning? What could he do?”</p>

<p>“They tell me that the hold you have on your military is
in the princely rewards offered to your veterans. And has
the Great-I-Am Himself a better name for keeping His
promises than you?”</p>

<p>Crossing to him, Dolores met his combative look with an
expression of affectionate concern.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see that you would put yourself under obligation
to advance one whom, quite naturally, you wish to
depose? Why not return him into the false security of
Elysium? After you have come into your own, he will be
one of your captives of state. You will then have the privilege
of wreaking your dislike on him as you see fit. Look on
him as end-of-the-season fruit. Let him ripen.”</p>

<p>“And be denied the taste of him now?” Satan licked his
lips. “Is this a trick, she-fiend, to wrest him from my clutch?
Have a care lest you, too, become disliked!”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of that.” With a laugh that came
strangely from her lips&mdash;luring, assured, golden&mdash;she
plucked the rose-bud off her ankle and, from tip-toe, flicked
it against his cheek. While placing it in his buttonhole, she
added: “You brand your warriors. Wear my brand, the
scarlet bud. You are mine, as I may be yours if only&mdash;&mdash;”
She drew away her laughing lips just as, almost, he had
accepted their challenge.</p>

<p>“Courtesan!” he accused. “What has inspired you, all at
once, with the best way to intrigue me&mdash;to make me doubt
your truth and fear your artifice?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I have not wished to intrigue you, as you say,
before. Perhaps my artifice has been in concealing myself.
Ah, Pluto, that even you have not guessed my trickery! I
wished to wait until sure of my own mind. Yours is so
dominant, it is hard to be sure. Since what you have said
this morning, I am ready to stand revealed. You have
aroused what you see in my eyes. You should be the last to
doubt. This is myself. The other was all pose&mdash;my best
asset on Earth.”</p>

<p>“You are worse than I thought,” he exulted. “I was
beginning almost to believe in your decency, so consistently
did you act. Then, after all, I am right?”</p>

<p>Again she laughed, this time with him. “Aren’t you
always right, you perpetual wrong? Of course there is no
right or wrong to what I’m asking you. Call it my caprice.
I’ve done a great deal to please you. Do one thing for me.”</p>

<p>“Make it something else, then.”</p>

<p>“Something else is never what one wishes.”</p>

<p>“But I suspect your request of being something more than
a caprice.”</p>

<p>“That even I cannot deceive you!” With the chagrined
exclamation, she thrust her arm in his and drew him aside.
Her head drooped, as if from embarrassment. In a low,
hesitant voice, she confessed: “You are too keen for me.
This request <i>does</i> matter to me. The truth is, I don’t want
my ex-only, as you call him, down here. Don’t you know
enough of woman’s nature to appreciate how I feel? I can’t
help the way I was born. I <i>am</i> a harlot at heart. Sooner
or later the bad habit of loving the old love might distract
me from the new. You saw last night that any conquest has
its charms for me. Why not&mdash;-”</p>

<p>She paused, as if to contemplate a fresh idea. Then: “I
shall need concentration to satisfy Your Lowness’ hopes of
me and concentration will come easier with not the humblest
of my ex-suitors to distract. General Cummings was
a deserter on Earth and, as you yourself said, once a deserter
always. Him, as well as John Cabot, you may treat with
fuller effect after The Day. Why not send the old nuisance
along? And there is one other of whom I should like to be
rid.”</p>

<p>“Who, pray, may this other be?”</p>

<p>“My babe.”</p>

<p>Satan showed himself assailable by surprise. “Not the
Littlest Devil? Now you have spoiled your argument. I
can’t believe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You will when I explain. Ineffectual looking as is my
child, she interferes with my whole-heartedness for evil.
She rouses soft feelings in me&mdash;impulses to protect the weak
and helpless. I’ll find it hard to live down even the thought
of her. To see her daily is a detriment. Focus that imagination
of yours, Pluto. Try to realize what you often must
have heard, that mother-love is the most enduring influence
in the universe.”</p>

<p>“That’s one thing I’ve never been&mdash;a mother. Wish I
had. I’d have given birth to some rare wastrels.” He
grinned at the thought.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see my argument? You will grant the favor
I ask? I dislike to plead as much as you, but I make this a
plea. Give me a chance in the one sincerity of my life.”</p>

<p>“Your one sincerity?”</p>

<p>He bent low to catch her murmured reproach.</p>

<p>“That <i>you</i> should need to ask! I, too, feel that I have my
one chance in you. If you are not strong enough to compel
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“One question.” His fingers snapped like a bracelet
around her wrist. “Why have you been at such pains to
arouse my jealousy of this weakling whom now you seem
to despise?”</p>

<p>Deliciously she smiled. “Ah, you humorists who cannot
see the joke on yourselves! Once you said that I was
humorous only in that I had no humor. Since, you have
taught me. Tell me, is not jealousy the rough stone that
whets an edge of love on attraction?”</p>

<p>“I’d sort of hate to part with the Littlest Devil,” His
Highness tentated. “It has seemed almost like having a child
of one’s own in the palace. If she were a boy, I don’t
believe I could. Strange, that hankering in the heart of the
worst of men and devils to reproduce himself in a son!”</p>

<p>He glanced up at his coat-of-arms, then back at her. The
peculiar intensity of his look was unendurable. Her lids
drooped over the consternation which she feared would show
in her eyes. But she pressed her advantage.</p>

<p>“I’d like the babe to go along, for her sake as well as my
own. Her crime was her parents’. You wouldn’t fancy that
third-to-fourth generation rule if you’d ever had a child.
Come, dear Devil, acknowledge that my reasons are good.
Let me have my way this once. Afterward you may
have&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Exactly what?”</p>

<p>She lifted her face, pale as a night flower, to the strong
light of his gaze.</p>

<p>“There is a question between us,” her lips murmured
reminder. “You can compel me, but you want my consent.
You spoke just now of a sporting proposition. Very well,
I’ll make you a bet. This favor I ask you against&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She could not control the shiver that seized her. The spit
of fork-tongued lightnings excused the droop of her face.
For a moment the growl of thunder silenced her voice.</p>

<p>“I can keep promises, too. This favor against&mdash;anything&mdash;you
want&mdash;of me.”</p>

<p>She had pledged&mdash;herself. Her two hands slipped within
his and clung, palm to palm. They and her voice shook with
loathing which she prayed he might mistake for the tremors
of love.</p>

<p>“Dear, <i>dear</i> Devil,” she begged him.</p>

<p>His answer was in terms of action. He returned to the
dais and seated himself in the throne-chair. He bade the
guard unhand their prisoner and sent the dwarfs to summon
those whose release had been stipulated by the famed siren as
her price. From a jewel-box he selected a fillet of pearls
supporting a single, magnificent drop of light, red as a tear
of blood. This he placed upon Dolores’ night-black hair. It
was, he made formal announcement, her betrothal crown.</p>

<p>Only John Cabot failed to salaam before the queen-elect.
Straight to her he strode; bent that only she might hear his
suppressed appeal.</p>

<p>“Do you expect me to believe in your inconstancy?” he
asked. “What force has crushed your courage, that you
hesitate to trust your fate to me? Because I seemed to fail
you on Earth, do you fear that I shall do so in this inter-world?
Is there no voice in your heart to tell you how
gladly I should have forfeited my passport to the Fields to
spare you this profanation? They say that Shadow Land
is only the waiting place. Wait with me, Dolores. Don’t
cast yourself too low for later recall.”</p>

<p>The persistence of his faith both shamed and blessed the
spirit-girl. Evidently he was struggling against the influence
of mal-appearances. How could she have doubted such
absolving love? For herself, surely her Hell was the there
and the now. She must remember that his safety and that of
the hapless atom born of their passion hung in the balance.
Yet even him and their babe she must have sacrificed, if
necessary, for the greater issue. The fate of the Universe,
which the Maker seemed to have forgot, depended upon the
pseudo-treachery of her looks and speech.</p>

<p>So far her determination had proved strong as desperate.
What that victory were defeat? What that she slew this
sturdy love of him she so longingly loved? The issue she
must not&mdash;<i>dared</i> not forget. To protect the great heart of
John Cabot from those thoughts of despair which, like ceaseless
drops of water on a stone, in time must wear away his
hope; to spare him who had defied the first law of Mystery
Land the realization of his own futility in the Lane of
Labors; to keep his forehead clean of that brand more significant
than the brand of Cain&mdash;the hate-sign of the Hadean
hordes; in saving him to send him as her messenger to warn
the Earth-blest of the Castling’s contemplated drive; through
him to reach the ear of One said to be omnipotent and arouse
Him from His lax protectorate&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Perhaps, if That Day was saved to righteousness, He
would be told of her and how she had tried to do her part.
As yesterday and to-day were so small a fraction of Eternity,
with all life’s reparations possible in the vast vacuum
of to-morrow, justice yet might be meted to Dolores.</p>

<p>His Majesty, she knew, had attended each word of John’s
plea. A single fault in the play of her part and her partial
success would end in failure. Not long enough for one of
his dart-like thoughts must she consider the soul-hurt to
herself. She, whom so often he had twitted for her simplicity,
had pitted her intelligence against the Master Mind.
Far better not to have attempted the deceit if she did not
deceive.</p>

<p>John she silenced with a mocking laugh. His amazement
she answered with assumed contempt. His protest she cut
short with ridicule.</p>

<p>“So you cannot progress for thought of me? Strange,
when here in Gehenna I have out-progressed my <i>penchant</i>
for you! Yet until to-day I did not realize how sleazy your
form would look to me or how weak would sound your
mawkings. One’s taste is best cultured by contrast.”</p>

<p>Her glance toward the King was eloquent interpretation.</p>

<p>“Don’t reproach me with my shamelessness, I beg of you,”
she anticipated him. “It is a point of pride with me. Away,
you weary me! Let this convince you that my fancy for you
died with my body.”</p>

<p>She struck him with her jasper-like wand across the lips.
At his low moan, the illusion of a red rose adorning its
handle went out.</p>

<p>Dolores, realizing that the light of his love also must have
been snuffed, scarcely could repress an echo of his protest
against her cruelty. Lest she fail in the climax of her
triumph, she turned from the sight of him; sank into the
prime minister’s chair.</p>

<p>Her courage was reinforced when the dwarfs dragged
Corporal Sam before the dais. The old soldier-soul’s shaken
state from only a few hours of “special treatment” accented
the necessity of his immediate release.</p>

<p>In the parting with her babe she felt free to indulge in
more of naturalness. She had confessed a weakness there
in the strength of her desire to overcome it. A moment she
held the small shade in her arms. But the cling of little arms
about her neck choked her with the necessity of untwining
them. So trustful, so young, so blameless, to be consigned
to punishment! The crush of desolation which pressed hard
on her heart might best be lifted by thought of a possible
day when she might see her child again&mdash;see her with her
trust, her youth, her blamelessness eternalized.</p>

<p>The precious salvage she consigned to John with not a
word of her heartful adjuration that he be good to her, take
care of her, teach her that her mother had loved her, even
as she had him, her best beloved, far too well to have and
hold.</p>

<p>No more did she risk the aside which she wished with
soldier Sam, in which to advise that he trust all his dread
knowledge to John Cabot. She felt sure, however, that he
would do so of his own accord. Once in the Fields, his
object would be her own in sending him. Gallant himself,
he soon would recognize gallantry and would give his
confidence to John.</p>

<p>The King was issuing orders. An adequate guard was to
serve as escort to the Elysian boundary, taking a wide detour
to escape the shade patrol. The fact that such a transfer
never before had been made need not concern them. The
love-hound had blazed a trail from Elysium down. Let him
blaze another from Gehenna up. They were to start at once.</p>

<p>Only John Cabot made his exit loathfully. After the
others had preceded him through the light-riven curtain, he
paused; turned. Dolores knew that to the last he hoped of
her. A gesture, a whisper, a sigh would have recalled him
to full faith. He had meant what he said. Gladly would he
have exchanged or shared her fate until that dim-distant
day when justice was to take the universe.</p>

<p>But she did not make the gesture, vent the whisper,
breathe the sigh. Rather, she forced the false laugh which
that hour had stood her in such good stead and turned,
affecting to think him gone, to her Satanic suitor. Seductively
she leaned, as if to consummate the caress which John’s
arrival had interrupted so short and yet so long a while
before.</p>

<p>At the downward swish of the hangings, however, she
drew back. The lilt of her laugh was lost in the realization
that he who had come to find her had left her, lost. More
moan than mirth it sounded at the thought that no lightning
flash or whip of wind in the storm-ridden air outside could
scourge him as had her treachery.</p>

<p>At her change of attitude, Satan sat back and watched her
with unsmiling scrutiny.</p>

<p>“It is not too late to call them back if you regret the terms
of our wager. ‘Anything’&mdash;wasn’t that your pledge?”</p>

<p>“But I do not wish them back. I am glad&mdash;so glad to be
rid of them.”</p>

<p>“And I. You acknowledge that I have won the bet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Your Lowness. You have&mdash;won.”</p>

<p>Any show of triumph he subdued. Even that peculiarly
calculating expression in his eyes, which before had dismayed
her, was covered by a sort of veil.</p>

<p>“The first thing I want of you,” said he quietly enough,
“is your agreement that to-night shall be our nuptial night.
I regret to dun a lady, yet I <i>don’t</i> like I. O. U.’s. Shall you
find it convenient to pay?”</p>

<p>“<i>And the sun became as sackcloth of hair and the
moon became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell
unto the earth, even as a figtree casteth her untimely
figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind; and the
heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled away;
and every mountain and island were moved out of
their places.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Long ago, when first she had become an object of diabolic
clemency, Dolores had supposed that, come a day, she was
to pay a price. When, after all the public pomp and private
pose of her regal rites, her new lord escorted her into the
throne-room&mdash;&mdash; Not until he stretched his arm in prideful
gesture toward the escutcheon over the dais&mdash;&mdash; Soul-sick,
she realized then the sum and coinage of that price.</p>

<p>To her chamber through the late afternoon Adeline had
brought reports of His Highness’ proclamation of the royal
alliance. Although he could not quiet the unprecedented
storm which had raged since high-noon and his electricians
had failed utterly to swing the imitation sun low enough to
send a single gleam through the clouds on this his wedding
day, preparations had been rushed. To the farthest reaches
of the kingdom great annunciators had blared through the
shriek of winds the bans. Not a rookie of the Hadean
hordes, not a wench of the Wanton’s Well, not the most
venomous whisperer of the Cage of In-Laws but knew that
the Belial Bachelor was to change his state.</p>

<p>And the news was made gladsome by a decree for cessation
of all punishment. For that eve the thought of despair
was taboo. The most fearing of shades was to be allowed a
breath of hope. Even in this clemency, however, the Rule of
Reversals would hold, according to the noble maid, since at
daybreak of the morrow all torments were to be resumed in
double force.</p>

<p>That Greater Gehenna should celebrate was not enough,
however, to satisfy His Majesty’s festive mood. Earth must
join in the rejoicing over his signal success in the most intricate
of games, even though the mortal participants might
not be told the cause back of their debauch. Through free
distribution of Devil’s Dew, a negotiable, bottled quintessence
of his own most iniquitous spirits, which had become a recent
output of distilleries under his direct control, there was to be
started that night a series of riots destined to belt the globe,
a spree of all nations that must have mortified the ancient
Bacchanalians, did wireless reports penetrate to their section
of the Realm.</p>

<p>The ceremony had been brief and the guests few. Original
Sin, looking particularly hypocritical in his crackling high-church
robes, officiated. Although none there was to give
away the spirit bride, the lack was dismissed with the groom’s
remark that, thanks to his inside knowledge of how to force
the affections female, she was her own free gift.</p>

<p>Perhaps never in all marriages of convenience on Earth
had sounded so sacrilegious the transposed lines of the
service.</p>

<p>Would Dolores take Satan to love, honor and obey, from
everlasting to everlasting, until he himself did them part?</p>

<p>She would.</p>

<p>And would Satan do his damnedest to love and cherish
Dolores?</p>

<p>Hell helping him, he would.</p>

<p>Almost before her change of estate could be realized, she
who had been despised of men stood before the Lower World
with a crown upon her head and a scepter in her hand.</p>

<p>Her lord’s first marital word had been a complaint. Why
hadn’t she worn the glittering amethystine costume which
he had ordered as her bridal robe? Did she think herself
still the shopgirl who had walked, once upon a time, into
Vincent Seff’s “slaughter of the innocents” that she should
come to her nuptials unadorned by any of the stage jewelry
which he had heaped upon her? Or had her late-learned
humor dictated her dress of virgin white?</p>

<p>She suspected indulgence, if not actual approval, behind
his show of displeasure. Himself he had arrayed faultlessly
in cutaway effect. His two departures from Earth’s accepted
mode lay in a scarlet cravat and his <i>boutonnière</i>. In lieu of
the conventional orange-blossom bud, he wore a tiny illuminated
nectarine.</p>

<p>As to so many women-souls before her sacrificed upon
the matrimonial altar, the subsequent feast was to Dolores
a tedious affair. Toasted in varied high-volt mixtures,
praised for her vices in the retroactive terms of the damned,
applauded uproariously for her inability to make brazen
reply as the arch-mistress of deceit, she had striven through
course after course to keep up appearances. What though
in the illusion of passion flowers that banked the board as a
centerpiece she saw only the reproach in the dark eyes of
John Cabot? What though her only taste from the adroit
food-phantasies was the unsatisfying reminder that she must
not regret her deception&mdash;must not allow herself to long for
him, lest her thought-clutch deter him from the brave deeds
that he must do? What though the only spirituous effect of
the wine she quaffed was the realization that, with every half-hour
now, the little party saved by her surrender must be
nearer that boundary over which not even the Prince of the
Power of the Air might recall them? With her black demi-watt
she sipped the conviction that, in the emergency, she
had done the best she could; with her electro-cordial frappé,
the hope that already John might understand&mdash;that all might
yet be well.</p>

<p>Now, with her gaze up-hung on the royal coat-of-arms,
that conviction became as “sackcloth of hair” and the moon
of her desire “as blood.” The stars of her hope-heaven fell
unto the Earth, “even as a figtree casteth her untimely figs
when shaken by a mighty wind.” All be well? “As a scroll
... when rolled away” was that sanguine possibility. Out
of their places were moved her every mountain of resolve
and island of faith.</p>

<p>She had declared herself ready to pay. Above was writ
the price.</p>

<p>From out the design, as of ebony and amethyst, still shone
the giant’s crown in bas-relief. The names of Japheth, Shem
and Ham continued to drip in ruby lights from the horns of
their respective lines. The caption beneath blazed brilliantly
through its sardonyx-thin lettering. Except for the
omission of two words the text read as before, “<span class="allsmcap">SATAN THE
FIRST AND LAST</span>” had been cut to “<span class="allsmcap">SATAN THE FIRST</span>.”</p>

<p>That so bold an announcement could be made by elision!
No longer did Satan the First boast himself the Last.
Through what roiled channels did his reasoning run?</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;” Words at last came of her consternation.
“I thought there could be no birth after the first death?”</p>

<p>He answered with guarded elation. “Someone you used
to believe in proved to you to-day that laws were made to be
broken. Surely I am the last whom that law of the first death
could coerce&mdash;I who never have died.”</p>

<p>“Nor were you born, Your Lowness. You say you had no
mother. Never have you been of the flesh, so how can you
expect&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am not to be classed with the flesh. I am a god,” he
interrupted. “Haven’t there been children of other gods?
Why, even the Great-I-Am had a morganatic son!”</p>

<p>Through a corridor of the palace he led her and into the
private wing of whose magnificence she often had heard.
Upon a divan sheened over as with an embroidered altar-cloth
he placed her; with one elbow crooked around the
hump of her knee, lolled at her feet; with a new possessorship
stroked her bare ankles and, at times, her throat and
cheeks. The while, he descanted in detail upon what he now
revealed as his “experiment.”</p>

<p>Only since meeting her had he foreseen a day when he
should find irksome his seat on the throne, when affairs of
state would bring him greater <i>ennui</i> than official sins <i>divertissement</i>.
After The Day, when he had been acknowledged
over all and the Universe had been let loose in an unending
administration of outlawry, would not he, as well as his
aides, be entitled to some reward of vice? And why continue
in a career of perpetual exertion after his utmost had been
done? As though human nature could not be trusted to
increase in evil of its own impetus, once punitive bars were
laid! Should not he be freed to tread the path of dalliance&mdash;to
realize some such gentle vices as he had seen to satisfy the
doughtiest devils of Earth?</p>

<p>Desire for an heir-apparent to his throne of late had grown
in him. Could she not imagine the outcome of his ambition&mdash;a
youthful demon born to dominance, bred to brutality,
schooled to undreamt possibilities of fiendishness? Strong
as steel in mental culpability, he should have the “chance”
denied his self-made sire. Never should he know, hence
should not fear defeat. With a super-divine intolerance, he
would accept and hold his sovereignty. Although of the
spirit, he should inherit a talent for strong visibility, taking
his form from his father and from his mother a subtlety
of appeal such as god nor man yet had possessed. A beauty
of countenance irresistible should be his&mdash;features of marble
pale as the ghosts of Dolores’ victims&mdash;lips that quivered
from the very delicacy of the lies they lied, eyes that veiled
in mists of mercy the utmost truculence.</p>

<p>Could she not see the child of his imagination? Let her
open wide those crime-dark eyes of hers; to-night let his
moth-like fancies bask in their purple flame.</p>

<p>When he, leaning against her, lifted himself to try his
thought, the bride-soul clutched her forehead and shuddered
back among the pillows as if to shield brain, as well as eyes.
Yet even to her own ears her protest sounded both sincere
and false.</p>

<p>“You must be mad&mdash;<i>mad</i>&mdash;to dream of such a thing.”</p>

<p>Was not the inspiration of all dreams mere madness? he
asked her. And was not that love which he aspired to feel
the first symptom of mental derangement? As for love’s
climax&mdash;as for passion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Always had he envied mortal men their carnal appetites.
There was nothing to being the King of Evil if he couldn’t
have all the vices. For æons had he hankered to glut himself
with food, and drink distorted images into his mind.
Now he hankered&mdash;&mdash; Oh, by no means to weaken himself
with this love over which she oh’d and ah’d! Really, though,
didn’t it seem too bad that he who had invented loveless lust
and incited it daily in a million earthlings, should enjoy it
only vicariously? Even before she had come to Shadow
Land, he confessed, he had felt the need of a second-worst
emotion. That night of the tale of her surrender to John
Cabot he’d decided on its nature. To think of the thousands
of years he’d wasted! To have been the two ultimates, archangel
and arch-fiend, without having been intermediate man!</p>

<p>As the lasciviousness of his look intensified, Dolores realized
in herself a certain sympathy. Appalled by its drawing
power, she reminded herself that only chaste aspirations
might conquer the crave for evil to which all mankind is
heir. Her lips formed to the names of her quondam
guardian companions.</p>

<p>“Innocentia, I do not wish to know these dreadful things.
Save me from the knowledge, dear, <i>dear</i> Amor.”</p>

<p>His Majesty’s chuckle sounded. They were gone forever,
the pet pests, he exulted. Ignorance should no longer be her
bliss. ’T were folly for her not to be wise. Why shirk
responsibility for the idea born of their acquaintance&mdash;one
wickeder, therefore more seducing, than any he alone had
conceived?</p>

<p>His further explication scorched her mind more hotly
than did his breath her cheek. Physical desire he might not
have. Yet was not its source, more than in the case of other
passions, a state of mind? Irrefutable proof lay in the fact
that desire wakened or slept as mortals fell in or out of love.
Did not the city rake, accustomed to think of satisfaction
as a necessity of his being, indulge it without love? And the
libertine husband&mdash;why did he seek it from fresh subjects if
not that his mind, wearied of his wife, must be freshly
inspired?</p>

<p>With every tale told him by Dolores these past nights and
nights, Satan had measured his mentality by that of each of
her earthly Don Juans. Averse at first to the weakness of
love, he had come to recognize it as the match which would
fire his affections and, thence, his desire. When he considered
the state of mind into which he could get through
hate&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He had come to the acknowledgment that, without love, he
had missed mightily. Now, he longed to strike the ineffectual
looking lucifer. Since, however, any satisfaction or outcome
of their alliance must result, more than in mortal
alliances, from a state of mind, he wished Dolores also to
long for love. That was why he plead when he might compel.
He could not risk an heir warped in his evil nature as had
been the Cabots’ in body. No toy pace-setter for the sins of
Satan the Second!</p>

<p>She was the match to fire his imagination, he told her.
She was the seemingly insipid drink which&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He interrupted himself to lick his lips. That fellow Seff
was right. One needed a nectarine. She was his nectarine.
She was very visible, as yet the most material of shades.
The ways of the world still controlled her. Once his wishes
were her own, she would of her own accord lift the stronger
cup to his lips; would press the cheek of ripe fruit against
his teeth. Already she had felt an impulse toward him. No
use for her to deny that in the throne-room that afternoon,
just before they had been interrupted&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“No. <i>No.</i>” The very necessity of Dolores’ denial, however
italicized in her consciousness the knowledge that she
lied.</p>

<p>As Satan passed his hand under her arm and pressed her
bust, she shrank from him with moaned aversion for the
thought back of the caress. He <i>was</i> like Vincent Seff. The
offense had been the shopman’s on that first day so very
long ago, when she had begun to learn of men. Then, as
now, she had been speechless from apprehension. Had that
apprehension come from subconscious knowledge of herself
more than of the man?</p>

<p>On Earth she had lived down certain inherent tendencies
because she had not understood. From His Highness’ first
touch she had trembled, even as on that day in Dr. Willard’s
study when she had implored the hunting parson of All
Mankind to teach her the religion said to cover game like
her from just such hunters as he. The carnality of mortals
she had come to excuse because component of the flesh.
Since, instead, it was shown her to be component of the
mind&mdash;since she was protected no longer by her innocence&mdash;since
here in the inter-world she was hunted by the most
expert of mental sportsmen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Dolores strove for perspective. How ghoulish an ambition,
this desire of Satan for desire! What could be more
inhuman than a passion of the imagination without hope?
And yet he hoped. <i>What</i> was his hope?</p>

<p>An odious thrill answered the question&mdash;a thrill which she
knew to be the first farthing of the price she was to pay.
The sum total, then, would be the development of her evil
possibilities to the utter obliteration of the good. All that
she had saved of her better self from her late estate was
to be burned to dross by that recognized flicker of passion
which had lit this conflagration. The King, by the heat of
his diabolical imaginings, would kindle, then fan her with
the winds of his swift thought. Her spiritual inflammability
was her real value to him, as had been that of her body to
men. He had praised, as had they, her beauty, her <i>naïveté</i>,
her teasing silences, but had passed without a glance others
as exceptional as she. That worst of her which, in the
physical, had wrecked her chances on Earth, would wreck
those mental which she still had hoped to realize in Shadow
Land. Even though she saved The Day to the Great-I-Am,
she would not by then be a fit subject for reward. Spiritually
ruined, she would be no mate for John Cabot. Well it was
that she had not known in time the fullness of the price,
else might she have been too niggard-souled to contract to
pay.</p>

<p>Forewarned in these premonitions of her fate, the spirit-girl
felt, as never in the past, her own impotency. Innocentia
gone, the love-lad Amor gone, her babe, gallant Old Sam,
and now John&mdash;all who might have helped her she had sent
beyond recall. Evil expectation was a compelling force; that
she had learned from Clarke Shayle. Even now, the Master
Mind was compelling her&mdash;vehemently, evilly expecting of
her. Would she give?</p>

<p>“I am a perfectly free immoral agent,” His Majesty
boasted. “You believe that, don’t you, my poor child? I
can seize your mind and hold it to the last split-second of
Eternity, whether you will or no. You liked that molecule
of suppressed power in your love-hound. Aren’t you
appealed to by the fact that I am at this moment suppressing
all the molecules of power that have run the world?”</p>

<p>Dolores felt shocked by several perceptions. He had
licked his lips; had called her “my child”; had concentrated
his magnetism upon her; with deliberate intent, was attracting
her through the same means used unintentionally by John
Cabot. As he argued, he bent upon her a smile no more
youthful or friendly than that of the lawyer who had won
her confidence only to spoil John’s life and her own. And
he wore a scarlet tie.</p>

<p>He was, in his conversion of her to his will, like each one
of those mortal men who had converted her. In one consummate
personality he combined their characteristics.
Everyman was a part of him. He was all men.</p>

<p>Since detached integrals of himself had brought her irrevocably
to grief on Earth, what chance had she to resist him
as a whole? Despite her guard, the despondent thought must
have shown in her face.</p>

<p>“You do not need to answer in words.” His Highness
pressed the point. “The idea of rectitude, grafted onto
women by convention, embarrasses you. Don’t think of
yielding to me. Think, rather, of yielding to your worse
and greater self. You, so lately and so rarely physical,
must share my mental hunger for the appetites. You will
feed me with thoughts of fulfillment? This passion that you
have aroused in mortal males, since born of the mind, on
the mind must have violent recoil. You will tell me&mdash;will
teach me? I shall not bore you. If the response of men
diverted you, how much greater the diversion of a god’s
response! Is it not an ambition worthy even of you&mdash;to
inspire the passion of an immortal whose fervor has not
been spent in birth or life or death? Think of my tireless
excesses, of my ingenuity, of my eternal crave for you!
Think of the procreative possibilities of a superman!”</p>

<p>“You explained to me yourself,” the girl-soul sobbed, “that
nothing could be created in Gehenna&mdash;that down here it is
always too late.”</p>

<p>“It is never too late for me to do worse.”</p>

<p>“But this heir you speak of&mdash;must he not come of a mother
as well as a father? I, at least, am subject to the rules that
govern earthlings. I have been born of the flesh and I have
died.”</p>

<p>“You quibble.” His frown showed irritation. “Aren’t
you lifted to my estate by our alliance? What you were
doesn’t matter, except that your late mortality brings new
vigor to our line. What you are becomes merged in me.
What you shall be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The hand that pressed up her arm and gripped her neck
pricked as with many needles from his impatience. Her head
he drew backward, as he lifted to his knees on the couch and
leaned over her. Her eyes dilated under the close gaze of
his. Her lips moved to the syllables of his slow, low
declaration.</p>

<p>“When the thought-lust in you has conquered your affectations&mdash;from
the moment of the consummation of the union
of our minds&mdash;you shall be a goddess&mdash;my goddess&mdash;for
aye.”</p>

<p>Strangely enough, his egotism did not offend her. An
expression of power, it bade fair to convince her. Warning
herself that she must not be convinced, she tried to get from
his grasp.</p>

<p>But he held her. “I’d love to love you, sweet Grief,” he
murmured close to her lips. “Ask me to kiss you, Dolores,
as once you asked a man of Earth. Beg me to take you, you
devil’s desire. Let our moment of forever start <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p>His reminder helped her to tear her will from his and
throw it, like a tangible thing, to the thought of John. Pushing
him away, she found voice to defy him.</p>

<p>“I’ll never ask you. That moment never can start.”</p>

<p>“Fair fiend, don’t try me too far. I want to want you. I
desire desire.”</p>

<p>As his fingers closed around Dolores’ throat, she was
weakened by the thought of strangling. She could not speak,
either to deny or implore.</p>

<p>“And you,” he rasped, “shall want me to want you until
you’ll pray that your mind may burn to ash from its own
ardor. Or will you teach me willingly&mdash;inspire me as you
best know how? I prefer to be your lover&mdash;to miss not a
nibble of that smooth cheek, my luscious nectarine. But I
am also your legal lord. And I have tutored too many legal
lords of Earth in their brutalities to miss my divine right
now. I am your master. Ask me to kiss you, slave.”</p>

<p>Dolores strove for the sort of courage that had enabled her
before to repel him. Just one strong, good thought might
release her. From the least likely source&mdash;his clutch of her&mdash;it
came. Baby fingers had clung tight about her throat a
few hours since. She was a mother, and a mother was
enslaved only by her motherhood. She freed herself of his
grip; struggled to her feet; started across the room.</p>

<p>“My wager did not include wants of my own,” she defied
him. “You ask more than I can pay.”</p>

<p>“More? I haven’t begun to ask!”</p>

<p>From the closeness of his voice she realized without glancing
back that he was following. The strength of her good
thought was scattered by panic. All she could do was to
flee.</p>

<p>She hurried to the windows, but found them shuttered
against the storm. Behind object after object of the room
she took a stand, only to desert it on his near approach.</p>

<p>He, like a fate evil, leisurely, sure to overtake, pursued.
He laughed from excess of exhilaration when the inevitable
occurred. Her long tulle-like veil caught about the winged
foot of an illusion of Mercury. As though by jealousy of
the speed god she was tripped; was about to fall. He caught
her.</p>

<p>“Why did you have to stop? This has been <i>wonderful</i>&mdash;never
could be so wonderful again! Whatever inspired you
with the knowledge that the way to ask is to deny?”</p>

<p>Freeing the veil, he wrapped it around and around her,
binding her hands to her sides.</p>

<p>“Your intuition is keener than all my keenness,” he
panted. “Of course the fleeing woman is the woman one
must overtake. To ask me you have aroused me to ask you.
Your lips, Dolores&mdash;I ask your lips.”</p>

<p>He flung her down; knotted the ends of the scarf about
her sandals; crowded over her. The lecherous look of him
silenced any protest. His eyes were aflame and from his
whole person fumed that ruddy effluvium which came of his
concentration.</p>

<p>As measured by the slow approach of his face to hers, a
death-time of dreading thoughts preoccupied Dolores.
Fragile as were her bonds, she could not throw them off.
Her resistance, she knew, was weakening. Suppose her mind
consented; what then?</p>

<p>Repeatedly had he forced her to his evil will; at times had
justified his boast of making her like&mdash;almost love him. Now
he was overcoming her as by a drug, none the easier to resist
because she knew it to be the soporific of sin. Did soul-lust,
then, beget soul-lust? Could he make her crave him to some
mental excess? Could spirit be welded with spirit in such
infernal way that the conscience would be raped as bodies
were raped on Earth&mdash;ruined for progress and admittance
among unsullied consciences after That Day?</p>

<p>And the outcome of such a ghoulish union? What manner
of offspring would be theirs&mdash;if offspring indeed there might
be&mdash;child-fiend incarnate&mdash;spirit-spawn of the passion of an
unbodied god?</p>

<p>For her to have begotten the heir-apparent of Gehenna&mdash;that
would prove righteous the Judgments of Men, even
should the Greater Judge consider revoking her decree.
Never again could she hope to see John Cabot and her babe.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She had fought her fight with such strength as she could
command. What though she lost her own immortal soul
through weakness&mdash;had not weakness as well as strength
been given unto her? She had not been wasted. She had
saved those two best-beloved. And, in saving them, had
she not saved the greater part of herself? All her loyalty
had gone with John. Their babe was the bloom of her
heart, that “one, half-blown rose” of the doomed gardener’s
plea. The safety of them who were all the good in her she
had bought. Surely the rest of her did not matter much.
Why now haggle over the price?</p>

<p>The query dismissed her resistance. Her mind opened to
her master’s mind, her eyes to his eyes, her lips to his lips.
A hideous impulse moved her, like the mania to leap from
some incalculable height. Thought-pulse for thought-pulse,
her sensation roused to his. A moan of torturing expectance
escaped her.... She closed her eyes....</p>

<p><i>She wanted to want him.</i></p>

<p>In the blackness, Dolores saw the blacker truth. Her
swooning sense of obligation to self was shocked into revival.
Not him so much as something in herself must she resist&mdash;that
desire put in woman to be mothers of men. Response
meant utter degradation. More culpable than he who had
not known the uplift of true love, she would sink lower far
in hate’s degeneration. Down and down ... always down
... forever and forever down....</p>

<p>“I am a woman soul&mdash;I must have love to live, not lust!”</p>

<p>With the cry, she tore herself out of his grasp. And as
she regained her feet, the bonds that had seemed so strong,
broke apart, like dampened tissue.</p>

<p>“<i>Vampire.</i>”</p>

<p>His Highness’ hands clutched for her loosened hair. As
again she fled him, he leaped in pursuit; abetted his steps
with his hands; pulled himself forward with grasps of this
and that. When he saw that she was trying the entrance
door, he stopped in derisive anticipation of her return. A
gleaming object from his pocket he waved at her, as illustration
of the mental ban:</p>

<p>“The key, my queen&mdash;come get the key.”</p>

<p>His chortles loudened at her desperate exclamation:</p>

<p>“If only I could pray!”</p>

<p>Abruptly, however, he ceased to laugh. He stood alone in
the chamber. The locked door had opened to his captive
bride. She had passed into the hall.</p>

<p>He followed. Nearer animal instincts than ever in his
past, his tall form bent until he ran on toes and finger-tips.
Through the private hallway he raced after her&mdash;along the
central corridor of the palace into the throne-room.</p>

<p>The great auditorium was dark, except for the jewel-voltage
of the altered Mephistophelian coat-of-arms. With
intent to point its full significance, the All-Man headed off
his quarry from doors and windows and drove her toward
the dais. There he seized the back-waving banner of her
hair and dragged her up the steps. With his free hand he
gestured upward.</p>

<p>“Your artistry is unexcelled, Queen Dolores&mdash;your sense
of fitness finer than mine own. That you should lead me
here is a right royal inspiration.”</p>

<p>Further excited by her struggles, he laughed the louder.
Sinking on one knee, he again crowded over her.</p>

<p>“You have taught me and I have learned. No longer do
I ask. I take. Lo, at this touch of you, resistant, I feel&mdash;I
<i>feel</i>! Your life&mdash;at this taste of them&mdash;a-ah, almost do I
taste! At last, fiend-houri&mdash;at last&mdash;at last&mdash;our eternal
moment has begun.”</p>

<p>As he held her head to the step, Dolores saw that the horns
which a few minutes before had been neatly trimmed, were
showing through his hair. Not daring to face the compelling
power which had made possible this phenomenon,
she shifted her gaze, first to the escutcheon, then quickly
to the dome.</p>

<p>“If only I knew you, God!”</p>

<p>“That name in my presence again?” Irony followed the
Belialic snarl. “Why hang back for an introduction if you
believe the Great-I-Am stronger than I? It wouldn’t be the
first time total stranger had rescued damsel in distress. Why
not ask Him, little heathen? It will do no harm to ask.”</p>

<p>Unloosening his hand from her hair, he jerked her to her
feet. Dolores, not knowing what next he might will, backed
to the wall. There, with eyes and arms uplifted, she acted
in earnest upon his mocking advice.</p>

<p>“<i>God save me</i>,” she voiced her first prayer. “I am sinking.
I shall be lost. Are you there, O God? Only you can
save my soul.”</p>

<p>Higher than the arch-blasphemer’s shrieks of derision,
fugued the storm winds without. At their demand, the entrance
doors swung wide; admitted them. Across the great
room they swept, gentling only at the flutter of veilings about
the girl-soul at bay against the wall.</p>

<p>Close after them lightnings slashed the darkness. Behind
her head, from tip to tip of her upraised hands, thence to
her sandled feet, they concentrated in rays of blinding light.</p>

<p>Crouched to spring, Satan fell back as if struck. In the
down-shed blaze his face worked with superstition. His
whine of a maddened dog slashed across the eyes with a
whip, ended in two gasped words.</p>

<p>“<i>The Cross!</i>”</p>

<p>Into power unmeasured by watts or kilowatts increased
the rays. They irradiated the face of her whose shape they
framed with a beauty never before seen in Gehenna&mdash;the
beauty of realized hope.</p>

<p>The uproar of the storm concentrated in one stupendous
crash. From out the contrasting stillnesses, there
then spoke a voice calmer and deeper than the deepest tone
of the sea&mdash;“a voice ... as the voice of many waters and
... of a great thunder and ... of harpers harping with
their harps”:</p>

<p>“<i>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</i>”</p>

<p>Prone fell the Destroyer, lest he be destroyed. Face downward
before that sign, which was the sign of his one fear,
he writhed upon the floor. From his forked tongue of a
snake hissed threats and pleas:</p>

<p>“Go away! How dare you trespass into the kingdom I
have made for myself? Don’t blast me. You promised time
until Judgment. I’ll give up the girl-shade. I’ll do anything
you say. Don’t blast me now. I might, you know, repent.”</p>

<p>Without daring to look up, he tugged at the hem of
Dolores’ robe.</p>

<p>“You’re to go&mdash;to leave Gehenna,” he upflung in his
immortal fright. “Don’t wait to prepare. Take this signet
ring. It will pass you through the gates. Hurry, lest you
ruin me with the rest of those that craved you. Go, Dolores.
As you love me&mdash;as you hate&mdash;for Hell’s sake, <i>go</i>!”</p>

<p>For long after she had gone he lay. Only his lips moved,
muttering.</p>

<p>“He could have finished me that time. He must have
certain powers of His own, like&mdash;like her. Since He can
come and go at will, I wonder why He waits. To-night&mdash;I
feel afraid&mdash;that my Great Intention&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The winds sounded to be subsiding. Evidently they had
roused in his spirit-bride’s defense. In time he risked a
glance toward the Sign. Entirely it had faded. Not a
glimmer of it remained to place that picture of wondrous
loveliness which lately it had lit.</p>

<p>A sob racked His Lowness. His hands searched about,
as though for some treasure he had lost.</p>

<p>“Dolores, <i>Dolores</i>, Grief to Men and me. What a fate,
to learn love from the loss of it!”</p>

<p>His fingers found something to clutch. Sitting up, he
examined what they contained&mdash;fragments of the illusion
of her veil. He bathed his face in them; swayed sensuously
to the feel of them.</p>

<p>“Even the mist of your memory weakens me. Wasted&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;when
I may never be so bad again?”</p>

<p>He became interested in a stinging sensation in one eye
never felt before. With a forefinger he touched the lid. Its
tip was not moist. Yet the pressure within increased. Excitement
caught him as he realized what must be about to
occur. He lifted his voice in a shouted command.</p>

<p>“Holder of the Tear Bowl! Quick&mdash;to hand&mdash;the Bowl!”</p>

<p>When only the reverberations of his voice made response,
he bemoaned the lost opportunity.</p>

<p>“Through the sorrows of all ages to expect it, only that,
when it comes, none should be here to catch it!”</p>

<p>It fell. A great, gleaming, heavy drop, it slipped from
beneath its lid. Salt as brine, it smarted as it rolled down
his cheek. Yet no watery, crocodile effluence was this. It
did not spatter on the floor. Lasting as a diamond it looked.</p>

<p>Carefully he picked it up. Solemnly he examined it. This
tear that he had shed&mdash;his first&mdash;was of that sincerest sort,
a tear of pity for himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The while, straight and swift as the spirit’s cry, Dolores
had fled the palace. Out of the portal and through the gate
she ran, past darting demons abroad to enjoy the fury of
the storm. A slim creature in white gleaming through the
blackness, she fluttered the imagination of a group of celebrants
staggering from an overplus of draughts inhaled to the
consort of the King. With raucous cries and out-clutching
hands, several pursued her. But too slow were they, or too
fleet she.</p>

<p>At the Gehennan gates, the guard fell back, advised by the
evil eye of the royal signet ring. Once safely outside, she
turned and flung the blazing trophy back to them.</p>

<p>Seemingly alone, she felt the presence of guards stronger
than they and more spiritual than herself. These she did not
fear to trust, so tenderly did shadowy wings seem to surround
her, so firmly was she steadied from stumbling, so
wise was the counsel she heard. Although the storm still
raged, lightnings concentrated before her and illumined her
way, as up and up she sped.</p>

<p>And with her sped happy thoughts. John she soon should
find. That she knew. Her feet were swift from lightsomeness
and he could not have progressed far, all weighted as he
was by the burden of his disappointment. Amor and Innocentia&mdash;even
now her sweet comrades must be seeking her.
All things of her they knew and never for long had they
deserted her. Since they were not born of Earth, they must
be well acquainted with the by-paths of this strange Beyond.
Should the way to John prove difficult, the love-lad would
lead her aright. And if reproach still looked from out
the soul of him she had forsworn, Innocentia would
appeal. John and their babe she soon should find and all
be well.</p>

<p>Broader and brighter before her shafted that penetrating
Light whose rays she had seen to reach the soddenest scenes
of Earth and the dankest depths of the Lower Land. Now it
dispersed the shadows from her dreading heart and darkened
mind.</p>

<p>Her former nescience, then, had not mattered to the Great-I-Am!
He had known her all along; had deplored her
plight; had awaited her wish for an introduction. That restraint
which so had fascinated her in one of Earth was but
an impulse from infinite restraint. No longer need she fear
for the fate of the Universe. The All-Power which had
restrained itself toward her that she might work out her
own development, would strike when the souls of men cried
out, even as she had cried, their dependence. Come The Day,
His Majesty would fail of his own impotency. Faith, then,
was not the fear of fools. Faith was the courage of gods
and men, a heritage divine.</p>

<p>No voice of sad women or of sobbing winds was Dolores’
as, peering and hurrying, her joy lifted in fragments of lines
learned from a singer on Earth.</p>

<p>“<i>Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom....</i>”</p>

<p>Now a flash of white through whiteness, she sped and
sang:</p>

<p>“<i>The night is dark and I am far from home....</i>”</p>

<p>Into the land of hope&mdash;into air so vital that realization
seemed already reached&mdash;into a life of no more sorrows, no
more tears&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>Lead Thou me on.</i>”</p>

<p>From neither sun nor moon came the glory that lit the
girl-soul’s way. She knew and knew. “Home” the Light
was leading her. From it she had come. To it she now was
returned.</p>

<p>The strength of that Hell she had fled was only hate.</p>

<p>The Light&mdash;the <i>Light</i> was Love.</p>

Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
